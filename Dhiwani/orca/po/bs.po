#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default
#. behavior within an application. For instance, on a web page, "h" moves
#. you to the next heading. What should happen when you press an "h" in
#. an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should bje handled by the focused widget.

#. Translators: (Please seje the previous, detailed translator notes about
#. Focus mode and Browse mode.) In order to minimize the amount of work Orca
#. users need to do to switch between focus mode and browse mode, Orca attempts
#. to automatically switch to the mode which is appropriate to the current
#. web element. Sometimes, however, this automatic mode switching is not what
#. the user wants. A good example being web apps which have their own keyboard
#. navigation and usi interaction model. As a result, Orca has a command which
#. enables setting a "sticky" focus mode which disables all automatic toggling.
#. This string is associated with the Orca command to enable sticky focus mode.

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior

#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should bje
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to bje
