          src/orca/speech_generator.py:
          Move Thunderbird-specific check to Thunderbird area

          There was some code in speech_generator.py that was looking
          for a window ending in ' - Thunderbird' as a means to prevent
          column headers from being spoken.  This code was fragile
          (and broken since the window can end with 'Mozilla Thunderbird').
          This code eliminates that check by putting the logic in the
          thunderbird speech generator.

	  First phase of working on bug #Bug 570658 – Refactor the speech
	  and braille generators.  This phase touches the speech
	  generators and makes things very much table driven (see the
	  formatting.py modules).  Aside from touching many modules, the
	  impact on the user should *hopefully* be unnoticeable.  That is,
	  the new tables are set up to provide the same speech output we
	  were getting before the refactor.  The next phases will be
	  migrating where am I support to the speech generator and then
	  working on braille.

          Fix for bgo#354471 - Text selection from braille input device

          This is the first step of implementing this feature.  Here's the
          behavior:

          KEY_CMD_CUTBEGIN (Dot 1 + cursor routing key on my display) -
          this will specify the start of a selection.  Orca will merely
          move the caret to the given spot and will clear any existing
          selection.

          KEY_CMD_CUTLINE (Dot 4 + cursor routing key on my display) -
          this will specify the end of a selection and the selected text
          is automatically copied to the system clipboard.  If a selection
          doesn't exist, Orca creates a new one where the other endpoint
          of the selection is where the caret is.  If a selection exists
          and the selection point is outside the existing selection, Orca
          extends the existing one.  If a selection exists and the
          selection point is inside the existing selection, Orca trims the
          selection from the right (i.e., the selected text that's after
          the selection point becomes unselected).

          Known issues that need to be resolved:

          1) This only works in text areas.  It doesn't work across things
             such as paragraphs in OpenOffice.

          2) There's some strangeness with speech feedback: it sometimes
             says "unselected" when the text is selected.  This should be
             fixable, but there also probably shouldn't be any speech
             feedback when doing this from the braille display.

          Fix for bgo#581372 - Move cursor routing and six dot key
          handling from braille.py to script

          With the cleanup from bgo#581532 to remove the custom brl module
          and move directly to the brlapi module provided by
          BrlTTY/BrlAPI, we are now able to handle BrlAPI commands much
          better.  This patch 'uncovers' the handling the cursor routing
          keys and the six dot keys; they are no longer swallowed/handled
          by the braille.py module alone.  Instead, they go to the script
          like any other event.  By default, the script just turns around
          and calls braille.py methods, but it can also feel free to
          override them.  For example, it might look at keyboard modifiers
          along with a cursor routing key to see if it wants to select
          text or not.

          As a note, the BrlAPI events come to us as a dictionary
          containing a bunch of information about the event.  For example,
          the cursor routing command contains information about which
          routing key was pressed.  The six dots command, which is used to
          turn contracted braille on or off, contains information about
          whether the user wants to turn contracted braille on (dots 2-3-5
          on my Baum display) or off (dots 2-3-6 on my Baum display).
          Right now, expressing interest in braille events is still done
          by the command (e.g., brlapi.KEY_CMD_HOME, brlapi.KEY_CMD_ROUTE,
          brlapi.KEY_CMD_SIXDOTS) and it is up to the event handler to
          determine how to handle the arguments.

        * src/orca/orca.py:
          src/orca/settings.py:
          Add setting to disable the pyatspi GIL idle handler:
          useGILIdleHandler.  This change is made in response to
          http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=576954 where it
          appears as though the GIL idle handler in pyatspi is causing
          consumers of pyatspi (e.g., Orca and accerciser) to start
          consuming 100% of a CPU when the machine is idle.  We're pretty
          sure the GIL handler is not necessary, so this change gets rid
          of it for the 2.27.1 development build of Orca.  If we see that
          users notice strange lock ups, however, we may need to change
          things back.

          3.1 (aka "Minefield"), please test Orca trunk with Firefox 3.0.
          We could really use your feedback regarding whether or not this
          solution solves things while the kinks are being worked out.
          Thanks much in advance!

          Fix for bug #554673 - 80 cells Brailledisplay not usable
          because of contextual braille Information.  This adds a
          latent "settings.enableBrailleContext" setting with a
          default value of True.  Set it to False to get rid of
          braille context.

          changed on the Firefox side of things which we need to deal

          state of affairs so that we can continue to check for regressions
          on our end and detect changes on the Firefox end. This also gets
          us testing with the 7-22 archive of the dojo toolkit. Changes in

          Get the oowriter tests working well with OOo DEV300_m25.
          They still don't succeed without unexpected failures, but
          they get along OK.  Still some work to do, and I think we
          also need to do a UI analysis -- some of the output seems
          a little cumbersome.

          We'll add support for additional widgets over time.  In order to
          minimize verbosity, this state is not presented by default. To
          change this setting, set orca.settings.presentRequiredState to
          True in your user-settings.py or orca-customizations.py. In
          addition, we've added in support for customizing the strings
          used to present the required state. By default, "required" (or
          the localized form of it) will be used for both speech and
          braille.  Modify orca.settings.brailleRequiredStateString and/or
          orca.settings.speechRequiredStateString if you would prefer a
          different string.

          src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py:
          Fix for bug #520494 - Keyboard review punctuation in Firefox.
          This fix reflects an across the board survery of our calls to
          the various speech.speak{Utterances,Character,KeyEvent,...}
          methods and attempts to make sure we call them appropriately.
          I also moves some logic into gnomespeechfactory.py in an
          attempt to delegate appropriately to the speech server factory.
          This has not been tested with the unsupported speech dispatcher
          support - we can update that as needed.  Note also that some
          of the regression tests will need some updating and that will
          come in a later commit.

          The remaining documents in here that are of any relevance are
          the user's guide and the internals guide.  The README describes
          how to make them.  NOTE that this was only a slash/burn
          operation -- the internals guide and user's guide were not
          brought up to date.

          Adjust regression tests as a result of an odd side effect from
          the fix for bug #519901.  By listening for window deactivated
          events, we are no longer inserting an empty string into the
          speech context.  Not sure why, but this new behavior is better
          than the old.

          In addition, also got to the bottom of why role_table.py was
          giving us differences between Ubuntu and Solaris -- turns out
          the 3rd column of the table is hidden on Ubuntu, but is exposed
          on Solaris.  Adjusted the tests by adding a regular expression
          to match on optional extra whitespace.

          Finally, also in row_table.py, we are indeed seeing different
          behavior between Hardy w/GNOME 2.22.1 and Solaris with
          Vermillion 88 (GNOME 2.22.20).  The difference is that you need
          to down arrow into the table on Ubuntu, but not on Solaris.
          Adjusted the rest, reluctantly, to do the down arrow only if you
          are not on Solaris.

          With these changes, gtk-demo runs wonderfully on snv_87 with
          Vermillion 88.  The only failures are the ones we expect
          (KNOWN_ISSUE and BUG?).  Yee Haa!

          20433.  BTW, 20433 happened to be my old telephone
          extension at work, so if that's any indication of what
          a hack I think the whole FireVox/Orca thing was...
          (it really was meant to be an interim solution until we

          also links.

          Fix for bug #483023 - Orca should give the user the ability to
          move between objects in order.  You can now use Orca+Left and
          Orca+Right to move from object to object.  This should come
          in handy for "escaping" combo boxes and lists in forms after
          making your selection.  Because these new commands treat each
          object as if it were on a line by itself, users who have
          requested this type of line navigation will hopefully find that
          this new functionality also addresses some of those needs.
          Please let us know.  Thanks!

          arrow to a combo box and want to it give focus, you can do
          several things:  Press Tab (as it's the next focusable item),
          press Orca+Tab (as it's the next form field, assuming your
          combo box is contained in a form), or press Alt+Down Arrow
          (which is the Firefox command to expand the current combo box).

          Thanks!!

          Work on bug #414762 - Control Home/End, Up/Down Arrow don't
          always work in Firefox.  Firefox still has some navigation
          issues which prevent things like Control Home and Control
          End from doing what we would want/expect.  Therefore, we've
          taken over these keystrokes by default. :-)  They should
          always move you to the top and bottom of the document now
          if Orca is controlling the caret.  If you would prefer to
          have Control Home and Control End exhibit the default FF
          behavior, toggle to a Gecko-controlled caret or change the
          keybindings in the Orca Preferences dialog for Minefield.

          sure the user can navigate to the areas.  That is what has
          been done.  We still need to present the elements and allow
          the user to navigate among them according to their spatial
          layout (e.g. reverse the list whose elements are ordered
          right-to-left).

          I'm writing a series of regression tests that are specific to
          the "performance enhancements" I'm working on and to a recent
          build of Firefox 3 in which whitespace is now added (where it
          belongs, but where we weren't expecting it).  See bug 505102.

          Add run_pylint.sh.in, which will turn into run_pylint.sh when
          you run configure.in.  This will pay attention to the --prefix
          you use (or don't use) so you're more likely to pylint the
          correct files.  By default, it will pylint just the files you've
          added or modified in your svn sandbox.  If you pass filenames to
          it, however, it will pylint them.  It only expects Orca Python
          modules, however, and only wants filenames of the form "foo.py"
          or "src/orca/foo.py".  In addition, it converts these filenames
          into paths that point to the installation directory.  If this
          doesn't make sense, well, look at script.  :-)

          src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #500193 - Update keybindings for reviewing previous
          messages.  The keybindings have been moved from the number keys
          to the F1-F9 keys.  Bookmarks are still on the number keys.

          NOTE: this effects the Orca learn mode key.  Instead of Orca+F1,
          it is now Orca+h.

          NOTE: this effects the review of previous messages in gaim and
          gnome-mud.  Instead of Orca+{1,2,3,...} to read the last nth
          message, you now use Orca+{F1,F2,F3,...}.

          NOTE: this also effects the debugging tools.  The new bindings
          are Orca+Ctrl+Alt+{the following}, where {the_following} is one
          of:

          reportScriptInfoHandler - End
          printActiveAppHandler   - Home

          More work on bug #486726 - Eliminate pychecker warnings/errors.
          Used "# pylint disable-msg" comment to work around issues with
          self._this() and _narrow.  Use orca.abort instead of os._exit().
          Used unicode operations instead of string module constants.

          More work on bug #486726 - Eliminate pychecker warnings/errors.
          Turned all calls to os._exit into calls to the orca.abort
          method.  Added a "# pylint disable-msg" comment to the abort
          method.  This gives us a 10.00/10 for orca.py.

        * src/orca/brlmon.py:
          More work on bug #486726 - Eliminate pychecker warnings/errors.
          Used the magic "# pylint: disable-msg=E1101" comment in the code
          to tell pylint we know what we're doing.  By putting it in the
          method, the disable-msg is directive is only active for the method.
          If it is put at the top of the file, however, it will be active
          for the whole file.  See also this URL:
          http://www.iaeste.or.at/doc/python2.3-pylint/html/FAQ.html
          Oh yeah, with this commit, brlmon.py is now 10.00/10.  :-)

          tests.  Switched the wait at the end to the new PauseAction().
          And finally: Caught a dumb mistake that was causing some timeouts.
          Now we are only timing out when Firefox lies to us and says a menu
          is really a menu item when it's really not. :-)

        Also start including expected speech and braille
        output into the *.py files so they are somewhat
        self contained.  Furthermore, as I encountered
        what *might* be bugs, I just flagged them as

        note that this functionality requires the latest gail from svn
        trunk. If you're using Feisty, your mileage may vary.  This is
        intended for GNOME 2.20 and beyond.

2007-08-13  Tomas Cerha  <via william.walker@sun.com>

        Fix for bug 455308 - Output module and voice selection with Speech
        Dispatcher backend.  The changes also involve some minor cleanup
        and one major improvement - automatic reconnection after losing
        Speech Dispatcher connection (for example after SD is restarted).

        * src/orca/speechdispatcherfactory.py: Try to import the `speechd'
        module globally and set the variables `_speechd_available' and
        `_speechd_version_ok' accordingly.
        (SpeechServer.list_output_modules): New method.
        (SpeechServer._getActiveServers): Method removed.
        (SpeechServer.getSpeechServers): Create one default server and one
        separate server for each available output module.
        (SpeechServer._getSpeechServer): New method.
        (getSpeechServer): Return the default server if `info' is not
        specified.
        (SpeechServer.__init__): Argument `lang' removed.  Rely on
        globally imported `speechd' module and the related variables.  If
        client initialization fails, log the error.  Initialize mapping
        constants here, not in `_init()'.
        (SpeechServer._init): Rely on globally imported `speechd' module.
        Don't set the default language, rely on language setting according
        to voice properties.  Don't initialize default voice properties,
        let them be initialized on the first speak command.
        (SpeechServer._send_command): New method allowing automatic
        reconnection after Speech Dispatcher restart.
        (SpeechServer._set_family):
        (SpeechServer._set_rate, SpeechServer._set_pitch)
        (SpeechServer._set_volume, SpeechServer._speak)
        (SpeechServer._cancel, SpeechServer.speakCharacter): Use
        `_send_command()' instead of calling the method directly.
        (SpeechServer.getVoiceFamilies): Set the locale of the default
        voice according to the current locale.  List snthesizer's voices.

        With these changes, I've had 6 simultaneous repeatable runs of

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/settings.py:
        add asyncMode setting (default=True).  If True, we run in our
        normal mode of operation of queueing events and processing

        immediately -- very helpful for testing repeatability.

2007-07-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        Work on regression testing.  There's still a ways to go, with
        the major problems being non-deterministic event ordering from:

         gnome-terminal: variable compressing of text-inserted events
                         from text resulting from the output of a command

         gedit:          differing event ordering between text inserted
                         events and name changed events for window title
                         going from "Unsaved" to "*Unsaved"

         OOo:            providing different user behavior for the same
                         keystrokes (e.g., down arrow in the Open Files
                         dialog sometimes takes you to the file list
                         header, sometimes it takes you to the file)

        I'm still working on the above, either trying to fix them or
        test around them.  One step at a time, though, and I want to
        get my work checked in just in case someone decides to steal
        my laptop.

        * src/tools/play_keystrokes.py, src/tools/record_keystrokes.py:
        use delta times instead of absolute times (makes for much easier
        editing of keystroke files).  Also simplify play_keystrokes.py
        and let it use delta times when playing back files.

        * test/harness/runone.sh: turn off gnome-terminal's dynamic
        title setting.  Also improve shutdown of OOo binaries.  Add
        ability to pass parameters to a command via the *.params file.
        Also move logic for logging output from the settings file to
        runone.sh.  Make the output log use the Python logging
        facility instead of debug.py, and save the output for speech
        and braille to separate files (makes the output easier to
        read and helps us also understand where differences lie).

        * test/harness/runall.sh: account for the fact that output
        is now logged to separate files.

        * test/keystrokes/*: migrate to delta times, also tweak all
        the tests to improve the timing of the keystrokes a bit.  Also
        make sure the tests actually tested *something*.  :-)

        src/orca/Gecko.py, src/orca/settings.py,
        src/orca/orca-setup.glade, src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: Work on bug
        #438333 - Need to present progress bar activity.  Implementation
        of speech support for progress bars as outlined by Mike in comment
        #6, plus the following changes (per email from Will):

          - Adjust the GUI for this particular feature to have a checkbox
            and a separate label/spin button. ie.:

            [ ] Speak Progress Bar Updates       Update Interval:  ( 10 )

            where the label/spin button pair would be inactivate/grayed if
            the checkbox wasn't checked, and the interval spin button went
            from 1 upwards in intervals of 1 with a default value of 10.

          - When progress bar is at 100%, we should present it, regardless
            of the interval.

          - There may be cases when more than one progress bar is updating
            at the same time in a window. If this is the case, then speak
            the index of this progress bar in the dictionary of known
            progress bars, as well as the value.

          Note that the progress bar currentValue isn't always a value in
          the range 0-100. You need to look at the minimumValue and the
          maximumValue to determine the range. Also fixed
          speechgenerator._getSpeechForProgressBar to reflect this.

          the system is no more usable after a short time.

          Adjusted the StarOffice script to use the new activate() and
          deactivate() script methods to initially set the value of the
          readTableCellRow setting to False when OOo is running, and
          restoring it to its previous value when that application is no

        If you can't wait, be sure that you have at least the 9th May
        build of Firefox and give the Find toolbar a try.  Also be
        sure to check out the additional settings on the Minefield
        pane of the Firefox app-specific settings dialog.  Hopefully

          Mouse move events don't update orca_state.lastInputEvent so
          it's possible the user accidentally nudged the mouse and
          generated another tooltip event. If the current time minus
          the last keyboard event time is greater than 0.2 seconds,
          than just ignore this tooltip event.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py:
        1. Fix for bug #436718: Navigating in focusable lists in
           Firefox's 7-May build hangs Orca. In this afternoon's Firefox,
           the children of lists in forms stopped being menu items and
           started being list items. The goal of this fix is to stop the
           hanging and re-enable list navigation under these new
           conditions. Note that Orca might declare items in form lists
           as "greyed."  As soon as I hear back from the Firefox guys as
           to whether this change was intentional or is a new bug, I'll
           adjust accordingly.
        * src/orca/Gecko.py, src/orca/default.py:
        2. Fix for bug #428114: Orca should attempt to detect erroneously-
           marked combo box labels in Firefox.  If a combo box's label
           consists of the entire contents of the combo box, the label
           is bogus and should be ignored.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
          Hopefully the last fix for bug #433146 - Add ability to
          configure app-unique settings via GUI. New app-specific
          keybindings are now automatically working (once they've
          been set), without having to Alt-Tab away and back or
          reloading Orca.

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          Part of the fallout of working on bug #435852 - Orca and
          OpenOffice Calc have a memory lovefest. The default setting
          for "readTableCellRow" is now False rather than True. This
          improves memory performance in OOo Calc spreadsheets which,
          by default, contain 256 cells per row.

          Note that as we now have application specific settings, it's
          possible to set "readTableCellRow" to True for individual
          applications (such as Evolution), easily overriding the default.

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          Boing said Zeppedee! The change setting "readTableCellRow" ito
          False has been removed. It's now back to True per comment #34
          from Mike in bug #435852.

          Hopefully the final fixes for bug #433146 - Add ability to
          configure app-unique settings via GUI.

          There were three problems:

          1/ In loadAppsettings() in focus_tracking_presenter.py, there
             was a bogus space in a call to self._knownAppSettings.has_key().

          2/ In _writeAppPreferencesPostamble() in orca_prefs.py, the import
             line that was written out for the <APPNAME>-customizations
             file needed to have an initial "app-settings.".

          3/ In writeUserPreferences() in app_gui_prefs.py, we needed to
             call the loadAppsettings() method in FocusTrackingPresenter to
             get the new key bindings to kick in for the currently running
             application.

2007-05-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/script.py:
          Slight fixup for bug #433146. Needed to define a "skeleton"
          def overrideAppKeyBindings(self, script, keyBindings) routine
          to prevent a traceback if there were no custom key bindings
          found.

          Also needed to check in loadAppSettings if the specified
          module name has an "overrideAppKeyBindings" attribute.

2007-05-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gaim.py:

          src/orca/Gecko.py:
          src/orca/orca_prefs.py:
          src/orca/app_gui_prefs.py:
          src/orca/script.py:
          Work on bug #433146 - Add ability to configure app-unique
          settings via GUI.

          Added two new methods to the Script class:
              def getAppPreferencesGUI(self):
              Returns a GtkVBox contain the application unique configuration
              GUI items for the current application.

              def setAppPreferences(self, prefs):
              Write out the application specific preferences lines and
              set the new values.

          Any application that has application unique settings need to
          overridge those methods any implement them.

          If <script>.getAppPreferencesGUI() does return something other
          than None (the default), then that is assumed to be a Gtk widget
          that can be given to a new tab in the application configuration
          dialog.

          Adjusted the gaim script to do exactly that. What this does seem
          to mean is that those settings values need to be global variables
          within the application script file rather than script variables
          (self.<whatever>).

          Similar adjustments for the StarOffice and Gecko scripts.

        * src/orca/app_gui_prefs.py:
          src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          Added in the application specific key bindings to the key bindings
          list in the application configuration dialog.

          Added in the writing out of the application specific key bindings
          to the ~/.orca/app-settings/<APPNAME>.py file.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
          Adjusted the loadAppSettings() method to pass in the current
          active script, so that the user's application specific key
          bindings can be set.

2007-04-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_prefs.py:
          Re-fixed bug 434394 - orca -t causes traceback.

2007-04-26  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: More work on bug 422924 - Add more support
        for accessing HTML tables in Firefox.  We now support non-uniform
        tables:  When you navigate to a non-uniform table using T or
        Shift + T, Orca will indicate that this is a non-uniform table.
        When using structual navigation by cell, if the cell you navigate
        to has multiple headers that apply to it such as "week 2" and
        "Thursday", we will speak those headers if they are different from
        the headers from our previous location.  We also announce cell
        coordinates when navigating using structural navigation among cells.
        And, finally, we announce cells that span more than one row or
        column.  Of course, depending on your preferences, that's a lot
        of verbiage.  :-)  Therefore, these are all customizable settings.
        In order to configure the different settings for now, use
        orca-customizations.py: Here are the *opposites* to the default:

        import orca.Gecko
        orca.Gecko.speakCellHeaders = False
        orca.Gecko.speakCellCoordinates = False
        orca.Gecko.speakCellSpan = False

        In addition, because some "data" tables include layout aspects
        such as empty cells, you now have the option of skipping these
        when using structural navigation to move among cells. By default,
        you'll hear blank.  To skip them set:

        orca.Gecko.skipBlankCells = True

        Note that the reason I'm checking this in now is so Rich can
        include these new settings in the app-unique settings feature
        he's implementing.  So if you wait a little while, you will
        also be able to change these via GUI. :-)

        * src/orca/orca.py: work on bug 412200 to unmark usage text and
        command line options for translation per gnome-i18n discussion.

2007-04-18  Lynn MonSanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * test/harness/runall.sh: Commented out the lines that compare
        the results file with the golden results file. I believe it
        is more useful to do the comparisons after runall.sh has
        completed. The runall.sh output just contains information about
        the test executions, not including the results.

        (Draft) directions for running the Orca regression tests are
        now in http://live.gnome.org/Orca/RegressionTesting

2007-04-18  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/where_am_I.py:
          Fix for bug #430278 - The Where_Am_I script does not work in most
          applications.

          No longer need to pass a speech context into the whereAmI()
          routine to get the application name. Application specific
          code is now in the app specific scripts. Moved the Evolution
          specific "where am I" code to the Evolution script.

          Fix for bug #427481 - "where am I" does not speak Evolution
          Mail...Tasks toggle buttons.

          The problem here was that those objects were toggle buttons and
          the whereAmI() routine did not have a generic catchall clause
          at the bottom to handle such objects.

2007-04-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/phonnames.py: add a URL to point to a Wikipedia
        entry on the NATO alphabet.

2007-04-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Add SunF37 as Solaris equivalent for F12.
        Also turn on Orca's caret navigation mode by default.

2007-04-17  Nickolay V. Shmyrev <via william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/phonnames.py: work on bug 412200 to provide a
        translatable string that is nicer to translators.

2007-04-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py: Fix for bug 430434 to make the key echo
        (but not word echo) be turned on by default.

2007-04-17  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Fix for bug 427722 - Web page separators
        cause Orca to get stuck with go{Next,Previous}Line. More work
        on bug 411261 - Some HTML constructs cause Orca to say just
        "Link" when arrowing up and down by line.

2007-04-17  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py: Workaround for Evolution bug
        347964 - When deleting messages in Evolution, Orca initially
        speaks the wrong tree item.

2007-04-17  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          src/orca/orca_prefs.py:
          src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          src/orca/scripts/gedit.py:
          src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          More work on bug #400716 - sayAll should be done by sentences.
          Added a "Say All By" combo box to the speech pane of the Orca
          Preferences dialog (accelerator is Alt-y). Current valid choices
          are "Line" and "Sentence". Adjusted the existing textLines()
          routines to use it.

2007-04-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py: minor bug fix and pychecker
        fix.

        * docs/planning.ods: reconcile with latest bug list, also
        pencil in more names to tasks.

2007-04-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/phonnames.py: work on bug 412200 to provide a more
        flexible means to define the military spelling dictionary.
        The new means allows translators to better support the nuances
        of their particular language.

2007-04-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gedit.py, src/orca/scripts/liferea.py,
        src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py, src/orca/scripts/gaim.py,
        src/orca/scripts/acroread.py,
        src/orca/scripts/gnome-search-tool.py,
        src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py, src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py,
        src/orca/scripts/gnome-mud.py, src/orca/scripts/users-admin.py,
        src/orca/phonnames.py: more work on bug 412200 to clarify things
        for translators and to fix up some ngettext and other stuff.  The
        remaining modules for 412200 are phonnames.py,
        pronunciation_dict.py, and orca.py.  These might be a bit tricky
        (phonenames because other languages may have military spelling for
        more than just a-z, and pronunciation_dict because we may want to
        allow translators to include common things for their language), so
        I have a couple questions into gnome-i18n.  orca.py remains because
        I also have a question into gnome-i18n about the appropriateness
        of translating command line options.

2007-04-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/settings.py: more work
        on bug 412200 to clarify things for translators.

2007-04-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/rolenames.py: more work on bug 412200 to clarify just
        what short braille, long braille, and spoken words mean, and to
        tag various things as being for each.  Poor translators for
        GNOME 2.18 had no clue.  My apologies.

2007-04-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: fix a typo in a comment.

        * src/orca/orca/py: more work on bug 412200.  Have a question
        into the gnome-i18n folks about best practices for command line
        options (should they or should they not be translated?).

2007-04-10  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * docs/doc-set/ue_requirements.sgml,
        * docs/doc-set/orca.html,
        * docs/doc-set/orca.pdf

          yet more Updates to the specs

2007-04-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 418147 to make sure we treat
        characters in strings as characters and not as bytes when spelling
        an item.

2007-04-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py, src/orca/orca-setup.glade: more
        work on bug 412200.  This completes work on orca_gui_prefs.py
        and gets rid of some of the more confusing strings that we
        received questions on.

2007-04-09  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Ripping out the layout table guesswork.
        As a result, you may land on layout tables that Firefox claims
        are data tables due to misidentification.  The good news is that
        Aaron Levanthal has proposed a patch to fix at least some of that
        on the Firefox side of things.

2007-04-09  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * docs/doc-set/ue_requirements.sgml,
        * docs/doc-set/orca.html,
        * docs/doc-set/orca.pdf

          Updates to specs

2007-04-09  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Several fixes:
        1) Bug 426336 - refactor Gecko.py's find{Next, Previous}Role.
           Also, L and Shift+L will only move you among ordered/unordered
           lists.  Before, form field lists were included because they,
           too, have a role of ROLE_LIST.

        2) Bug 426684 - Orca does not speak entry text in Firefox when the
           caret is at the end of line.   This fix also solves Bug 426687
           - Orca should only speak entry text when arrowing Up/Down in an
           entry in Firefox.

        3) Bug 413990 - [blocked] orca should not speak table over and over
           again when tabbing through a web page.  This fix should also
           make it less likely that T and Shift+T will land on layout
           tables.

2007-04-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/Gecko.py,
        src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: fix for bug 423439 to reduce
        chattiness of speech context.

2007-04-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/metacity.py: fix for bug 427880 to restore
        the metcity behavior of speaking the name of the window to get
        focus when you're doing an Alt+Tab.

2007-04-09  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: The remainder of the fix for bug #414926:
        Orca should announce the level of headings in Firefox.  Speech
        was added a while back; now it brailles the level too.

2007-04-09  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * docs/doc-set/ue_requirements.sgml,

          Updated more specs I'll update the web site docs when I'm done

2007-04-07  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/default.py: slight modification to the fix for bug
        #400716 - [requirement] sayAll should be done by sentences.
        textLines() tries TEXT_BOUNDARY_SENTENCE_END and if it gets
        absolutely nothing in response, it falls back on the old
        TEXT_BOUNDARY_LINE_START that we were using.  What this means
        is that some applications, such as gnome-terminal, will once
        again have a functional sayAll but will need special handling
        added to have sayAll by sentence.

2007-04-06  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/scripts/gedit.py:
          src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Fix for bug #400716 - [requirement] sayAll should be done by
          sentences..
          textLines() now uses TEXT_BOUNDARY_SENTENCE_END instead of
          TEXT_BOUNDARY_LINE_START to break apart chunks to read (thanks
          Will!)

          Fix appears to work nicely for gedit, OOo Writer and Evolution.

          It still needs to be implemented for Firefox, but that's a
          separate bug (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=426360).

2007-04-06  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * docs/doc-set/ue_requirements.sgml,

          Updating the specs I'll update the web site docs when I'm done

2007-04-06  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Removed the partial fix for bug #422487 - Ability to jump to
          the start of the message in Evolution. We will wait for the
          Evolution folks to implement bug #423395.

2007-04-05  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>
        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/settings.py,
        src/orca/scripts/gnome-panel.py: removed extra double-space
        and trailing-whitespace from files.

2007-04-05  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Fix for bug #423198 - Orca should not speak
        "text" repeatedly when moving around in a text entry area on a
        web page.

2007-04-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py: more work on bug 412200 to
        better handle 'y'/'n' type questions on the command line and
        to add more comments for translators.

2007-04-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/keynames.py, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/keybindings.py,
        src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: more work on bug 412200 to add
        documentation where needed and to unflag some things for
        translation.  This completes work on keynames.py and
        keybindings.py.  The next beast is orca_console_prefs.py.

2007-04-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Reinstate:
            def _getCalcFrameAndSheet(self, obj):
            def _speakCalcStatusBar(self):

2007-04-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/where_am_I.py, src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py,
        src/orca/speechgenerator.py: more work on bug 412200 to
        remove bizarre '_("%s") % text' constructs.  Also added
        more docs as appropriate as a means to finish out the
        work on where_am_I.py.

2007-04-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/planning.ods: well...I didn't get much of a chance
        to do too much with this today, but I'm checking what I
        was able to do between phone calls.

2007-04-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: more work on bug 398009 to reduce
        chattiness when moving across objects in a toolbar while
        tooltips are up.

2007-04-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/where_am_I.py: more work on
        bug 398009 to better handle tooltips when they appear and
        disappear.

2007-04-03  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py
          Cleaned up what is considered a large object.

2007-04-03  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>
        * src/orca/default.py: Removed Orca control-F1 keybinding which
        overroad the Gnome control-F1 binding. With this change,
        control-F1 causes a modal change. When control-F1 is first pressed,
        tooltips are always displayed when the user navigates to the next
        object that supports tooltips. Orca first reads the object name,
        then the tooltip. Pressing control-F1 a second time causes the
        application to exit "tooltip displayed mode." Navigating to the
        next object that supports tooltips causes Orca to just speak
        the object name.

        Bug #3980009 - Orca should be able to tooltip text for an object

2007-04-03  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/planning.ods: update to include rough prioritization
        based upon input from team and conversation with Mike.

2007-04-03  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>
        * src/orca/default.py: Removed Orca control-F1 keybinding which
        overroad the Gnome control-F1 binding. With this change,
        control-F1 causes a modal change. When control-F1 is first pressed,
        tooltips are always displayed when the user navigates to the next
        object that supports tooltips. Orca first reads the object name,
        then the tooltip. Pressing control-F1 a second time causes the
        application to exit "tooltip displayed mode." Navigating to the
        next object that supports tooltips causes Orca to just speak
        the object name.

        Bug #3980009 - Orca should be able to tooltip text for an object

2007-04-03  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py: Additional fix for
        Bug 368626 - [blocked] Orca accessing tool tips from gnome-panel
        causes gnome-panel to crash.

        Moved setting of settings.presentTooltips from orca.py to
        settings.py. This makes it possible for users to override
        the setting.

2007-04-03  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          Further fixup for bug #413109 from Joanie (thanks!)
          Adds combo box and slider mnemonics to Orca preferences.

2007-04-02  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>
        * src/orca/default.py: Added a "present tooltip" keybinding
        which is mapped to control-F1. Pressing control-F1 causes
        Orca to speak and braille the tooltip for the object that
        has keyboard focus. This has only been tested with gedit.
        For example, pressing control-F1 when a "Replace" button has
        focus, causes Orca to speak and braille "Search for and
        replace text".

        Bug #3980009 - Orca should be able to tooltip text for an object

2007-04-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py, src/orca/Gecko.py: work on bug
        412200 to provide more comments for translators.

        Orca accessing tool tips from gnome-panel causes gnome-panel
        to crash.

2007-04-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/planning.ods: update to include bugs as of this morning

2007-04-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/espeechfactory.py, src/orca/find.py,
        src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: work on bug 412200 to
        provide more comments for translators.  The next big beast
        in line is Gecko.py.

        * src/orca/acss.py: fix problem where the name of an ACSS
        wasn't being properly updated.

          Fix for bug #425498 - option to allow Orca to quit without
          confirmation when user presses Insert-q.

2007-04-02  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Partial fix for bug #416971 Orca does not
        speak or braille numbers/bullets of list items in Firefox.

2007-03-29  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * docs/man/orca.sgml:  (removed).
          Part of the fix for bug #414981 - Orca manual pages for 2.18.

        * src/orca/orca-find.glade:
          src/orca/orca-quit.glade:
          src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          Fix for bug #413109 - HIG violations. Revamped Glade files from
          Calum Benson (thanks!)

2007-03-28  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/rolenames.py, src/orca/where_am_I.py:
        work on bug 412200.  This should hopefully finish work on default.py.

        * src/orca/default.py: work on bug 412200 to use ngettext for
        presentation of number of tabs and spaces on a line.

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py, src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py,
        src/orca/default.py, src/orca/Gecko.py, src/orca/where_am_I.py:
        more comments for translators for bug 412200 and also unmark some
        debug strings as being marked for translation.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
        src/orca/chnames.py, src/orca/J2SE-access-bridge.py,
        src/orca/where_am_I.py, src/orca/braille.py: start adding
        comments for translators as part of work for bug 412200.

2007-03-28  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * configure.in, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/orca_prefs.py,
        src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py, src/orca/settings.py: Fix for bug
        423738 to refactor gconf queries to use gconf module instead of
        execing out via the commands module.

2007-03-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * docs/man/orca.1:
          Fix for bug #414981 - Orca manual pages for 2.18.
          Actually the manual pages for beyond 2.18. Revised to just give
          name, synopsis, brief description, command line options, author
          and see also, which gives pointers to the Orca wiki and mailing
          list.

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Fix for bug #422487 - Ability to jump to the start of the message
          in Evolution. Focus (and text caret) are now moved to the first
          line of the mail message. That first lines is brailled and spoken.

          Further changes to move the StarOffice specific code into a
          subclass of the WhereAmI class in the StarOffice.py script.

          Removed four routines that weren't being used:
          _getCalcFrameAndSheet(self, obj)
          _speakCalcStatusBar(self)
          _getPositionInComboBox(self, obj, name)
          _getCheckBox(self, obj)

        * src/tools/play_keystrokes.py: bug #415061 - Modified
        keystroke playback to pause before each key press. This
        takes keystroke modifier keys and chords into account.

2007-03-27  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Change to getCellCoordinates().  Seems like
        we're getting correct info from Firefox now.  AND the old work
        around is causing us to have incorrect coordinates when tables have
        captions.

2007-03-27  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Added list item structural navigation now
        that list items are no longer considered to be "large objects".
        I and Shift+I move you among list items. (See bug #423537).
        Speaking of large objects, according to bug #423531, O/Shift+O
        should not stop on images and Orca should say "large objects"
        instead of chunks.  Done. :-)  Finally, it seems that a few
        of the structural navigation commands were not updating the
        braille display when going to the previous <whatever>.  This
        is also fixed.

2007-03-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:

          routine, as the variable "i" was being used.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/hierarchical_presenter.py,
        src/orca/Makefile.am, docs/pydoc/Makefile.am: fix for bug 319778
        to remove hierarchical_presenter.

2007-03-27  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Added more structural navigation: You can
        now use 1 through 6 and Shift+1 through Shift+6 to navigate among
        headings by level (see bug #423214).  In addition, I checked in
        Will's related partial patch for bug #414926 (Orca should announce
        the level of headings in Firefox).  We still need to provide that
        information via braille.  Structural navigation for HTML tables has
        been added:  T and Shift+T move you among tables.  Alt+Shift+the
        arrow keys will move you among table cells, and Alt+Shift+Home/End
        will move you to the top/bottom of the current table (see bug
        #422924).  Finally list items are no longer considered "large
        objects" for the purpose of navigating with O/Shift+O due to the
        prevalence of lists of links in sidebars, etc. (see bug #423404)
        We will add I and Shift+I for list item navigation soon.

2007-03-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/where_am_I.py:
          Refactored the where_am_I.whereAmI() routines. They are now in
          a WhereAmI class in the where_am_I.py file. the current script
          is passed into the __init__() method. All references to
          orca_state.activeScript have been replaced with self._script.
          Removed extra blank lines and spurious whitespace.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Fix for bug #419089 - Refactor StarOffice.py script.
          Now that we have self._script available to the SpeechGenerator
          and BrailleGenerator classes, the StarOffice.py scripts needed to
          be adjusted to move all the global routines into the Script() class.

2007-03-26  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * test/harness/runone.sh, test/harness/runall.sh,
        src/tools/play_keystrokes.py: bug #415061 - Adjusted
        keystroke playback timing for navigation keys. There
        are still minor diffs between non-OpenOffice runs
        of runall.sh. This is probably okay for regression
        testing, but it does require someone to manually
        check the diffs every morning to verify there are
        no significant changes between runs.

        Note that there are still significant diffs between
        OpenOffice Writer and Calc runs. These are due
        to real bugs that need to be fixed.

        To Do: I need to modify runone.sh so that the user
        doen't need to specify whether code-coverage testing
        is done (1) or not done (0). Right not, you need to
        add a 0 or 1 at the end of the runone.sh command
        arguments. The runall.sh script always specifies a
        0 or 1.

        Link structural navigation:  U moves you to the next
        unvisited link; Shift U to the previous unvisited link;
        V to the next visited link; Shift V to the previous

        Control O and Control H now work as expected.  Added
        List structural navigation:  L moves you to the next
        list; Shift L moves you to the previous list.  See bug
        416908.

2007-03-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

          Reworked changes for bug #404052 - Say something to let the

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:

        * test/harness/runone.sh, test/harness/runall.sh: Partial
        fix for bug #412837 - Orca needs test code coverage reporting.
        Run test/harness/runall.sh with the '-c' flag. This will cause
        test2html to generate a code coverage report in the
        test/coverage directory. The report can be viewed by opening
        index.html in the code coverage subdirectory, that is labelled
        by the date and time that runall.sh completed.

        NOTE: After runall.sh completes, Orca will still be running.
        In order to generate the code coverage report for this run
        of runall.sh, it is necessary to quit Orca from the Orca dialog.
        This needs to be fixed.

          the same changes as were made for GNOME 2.18 (in the gnome-2-18
          branch).
          - Added in text for new command line options:
            -u --user-prefs-dir
            -e --enable
            -d --disable
          - Added two new entries to the flat review section:
            o Numpad-enter for "Where am I"
            o Numpad-delete to bring up the "Find" dialog
          - Adjusted the Numpad-5 entry to include:
            "Double tap on Numpad-5 to spell word, triple tap on Numpad-5
            to get military spelling.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/flat_review.py:
        partial fix for bug 408071 to prevent Orca from reading content
        in tabs that really are not on the screen, but Gecko is telling us
        they are there.

2007-03-04  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: fix for bug 414360: if a character claims
        to have a negative width and/or height, ignore that character.

2007-03-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: fix for bug 414585 to speak/braille the title

2007-03-03  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * bugs/bugs.html: added another Firefox bug.

2007-03-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py: add mapping from "Mail/News" to
        "Thunderbird" script to accomodate new name change.
        (Thanks Rich!)

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: do a bit of work to make this
        work with our target version of Thunderbird (version 3.0).

2007-03-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/mag.py: add addZoomRegion call to get this
        working better with gnome-mag.  NOTE: the COMPOSITE
        extension has issues on Ubuntu (perhaps X11R7.2.0).
        The gnome-mag magnifier should be run with the
        --ignore-composite flag.  You can force this to
        happen by modifying the exe line in
        /usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_Magnifier.server to:
        type="exe" location="/usr/bin/magnifier --ignore-composite">
        This will be the default for GNOME 2.18 (or so Carlos
        and I agreed tonight :-)).

2007-03-02  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: fix for bug 413253 to keep Orca from
        getting stuck on images that were links and to prevent it
        from skipping over really small text when navigating by line:
        two side effects of the original fix to bug 411261.

2007-03-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: fix for bug 408670 to provide better

        Thunderbird and Firefox.

2007-03-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/punctuation_settings.py: fix bug 413457 to prevent
        Orca from speaking various names for the "-" twice in a row
        in German.

2007-02-28  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * test/html/image-test.html: another test case where Orca
        gets stuck with navigation.

2007-02-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Adjusted the readMisspeltWord() routine to initially set startOff
          to zero, to prevent tracebacks when currently spell checking
          against oowriter in OOo v2.1 (or later) -- because the text in the
          paragraph in the spellcheck dialog no longer has text attributes.
          Doesn't fix spell checking, but it no longer causes a traceback.

        * src/orca/test_coverage.py, src/orca/coverage.py
        src/orca/orca.in, src/test/runone.sh, src/test/runall.sh: revert
        the test coverage change.  It's too risky for GNOME 2.18.  Let's
        also wait to discuss this after the branch for GNOME 2.19.  I'd
        like to explore ways to not require any changes under the src
        directory.  My hope is that it can all be isolated to the
        test/harness directory.

2007-02-27  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * bugs/bugs.html: added another Firefox/Thunderbird bug.

2007-02-27  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/test_coverage.py, src/orca/coverage.py
        src/orca/orca.in, src/test/runone.sh, src/test/runall.sh:

        First cut at getting code test coverage for Orca. Coverage
        testing is done using the coverage.py package developed by
        Ned Batchelder.
        (http://www.nedbatchelder.com/code/modules/rees-coverage.html)
        I put src/orca/coverage.py under SVN control since it it
        not normally included in Python distributions.

        src/orca/test_coverage.py needs a lot of refinement! For example,
        the orca modules to test were manually entered into the source
        file.

        The code coverage reports need to be converted to a more
        friendly HTML format.

        To invoke code coverage testing: run runall.sh with the "-Z"
        flag.


2007-02-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/orca_prefs.py:
        allow for better filtering of events.  Also include sample line
        in user-settings.py (commented out) to show how to eliminate
        logging of bounds-changed events.

2007-02-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: add more Firefox bugs.

2007-02-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * Final prep for v2.17.92.

        * NEWS, po/POTFILES.in, src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am,
        docs/pydoc/Makefile.am, src/orca/scripts/nautilus.py: remove
        Nautilus script until GNOME 2.19.x.

2007-02-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: fix for bug 411261 to better navigate by
        line in the presence of linebreaks (<br>'s) in HTML content.

2007-02-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: initial prep for v2.17.92.

2007-02-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: work on bug 407948 to better handle
        object and header navigation in Firefox via {Shift+}{o,h}.

2007-02-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * test/html/simpleheader.html: include some more test
        cases for where Orca gets stuck with navigation.

2007-02-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: fix for bug 412058 to terminate the python
        process better when it receives a TERM signal.  Note that one must
        send the TERM signal directly to the Python process.  Sending it
        to the shell script won't do since the shell script turns around
        and does a kill -9 on the Python process when it gets a TERM
        signal.  The motivation for this is to better support the code
        coverage analysis work that is being done by Lynn.

2007-02-22  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gnome-power-manager,py. Addional fix
        for bug #354479. The Gnome Power Manager communicates
        information about power management state in the object
        description in "object:bounds-changed" events. It is
        necessary to turn of the caching of accessible values
        to force the power manager to send the current power
        management state, othrwise the old cached description
        is returned for the object.

2007-02-22  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * bugs/bugs.html: added several new Firefox bugs.

2007-02-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: a little work on bug 407948 to handle
        {Shift+}{o,h} to move to previous and next {object, header}.
        It's not perfect (there are still issues with the URLs in
        the bug report), but it is better and seems to get "stuck"
        less frequently.

2007-02-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_i18n.py.in: add ngettext reference for use by
        other modules.

2007-02-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/pydoc/Makefile.am: add find, gnome-power-manager, nautilus,
        and Thunderbird modules to pydoc target.

2007-02-20  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.in: additional fix for bug 407480 to make sure
        this works with the grep/egrep in /usr/bin on Solaris.

2007-02-19  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Removed unnecessary
        code that work around Thunderbird bugs that have fixed.
        Yeh! The workaround code could have been a source of
        regressions as Thunderbird changes. Also added comments
        giving more information about the reason for the
        workarounds, and why the code may need to be removed
        or modified when Thunderbird changes. The same goes
        for changes to Gecko.py. Bug #409708

        Note: I tested for regressions, but removing this much
        code could have caused regressions that I have not found.
        The code changes are isolated in Thunderbird.py, so they
        should not cause any core regressions. Thunderbird needs
        be be tested more by others.


2007-02-19  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Additional fix for
        Bug #381455: replaced an accidently deleted "if not consume"
        statement.


2007-02-19  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: I reopened Bug #381455
        for two reasons:

        - to document that this problem was a general one where
        Thunderbird did not the present labels around dialog text
        entries For example, in the Preferences/Composition/General
        panel, Thunderbird did not present the "minutes" label after
        the "Autosave every" text entry.

        - to show the patch for removing the code in Thunderbird.py
        that worked around this problem. It appears that Thunderbird
        is now setting the LABELLED_BY and LABEL_FOR relations correctly.
        There is no longer a need for a workaround.


2007-02-19  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: This is a better fix for
        bug #405541. Thunderbird gives focus to the cell in the column
        that is being sorted (e.g., Date). Braille should show the row
        from the begining. This fix calls orca.setLocusOfFocus to give
        focus to the cell at the beginning of the row.


2007-02-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * test/html/simpleform.html: add a text entry area that uses
        an onFocus tag to reset the value when you tab to it.  Gecko
        seems to have issues with its accessible implementation when
        it comes to these kinds of things.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: update some documentation, ensure braille
        is updated when a page is finished loading, and handle the
        case where the caret offset of a text area is a nonsensical
        value (-1) when you tab into it.

        * src/orca/util.py: modify getTextLineAtCaret to return the sole
        character if the length of the text is 1.  We do this because
        Gecko's getTextAtOffset implementation seems to be flawed if the
        length of the text is 1.

2007-02-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/nautilus.py:
          Changed _(" %d items") to " %d items" as there is a string
          freeze on.

2007-02-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: revert to revision 1994 since
        the change below (revision 2018) made reading HTML messages
        difficult.

2007-02-15  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gnome-power-manager.py: Partial fix
        for Bug #354479 - Automatic presentation of "balloon"
        type messages. The partial fix speaks the displayed
        text in the Gnome Power Manager when the manager is
        displayed. There will probably need to be scripts for
        all the other important balloon-type messages.

        * src/orca/default.py: Added a listener for
        "object:bounds-changed:" events. The onBoundsChanged
        method is intended to be overridden by subclasses; in
        this case, gnome-power-manager.py


2007-02-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: do a fair amount of work to
        make the message composition window work better.

2007-02-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #408174 - Some laptop keybindings defined in
          default.py doesn't work
          (Thanks to community member Juan Ramon Jimenez for this fix).

        * src/orca/scripts/nautilus.py: (new)
          src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am:
          Fix for bug #350674 - make Orca announce when a new folder is
          opened and announce number of items.

2007-02-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: add Insert+F12 as a means to toggle between
        Orca controlling the caret and Firefox controlling the caret in
        HTML content.  The change is not persistent between runs.  If
        you want a persistent setting, use something like the following
        in your ~/.orca/orca-customizations.py file:

        import orca.Gecko
        orca.Gecko.controlCaretNavigation = True

        NOTE: the strings presented as a result of this change are
        currently not marked as needing translation.  There are also
        several other strings I had missed from earlier work.  So...I'm
        going to just check this stuff in and request a string freeze
        break for the whole set of strings at once.  I'm a dope and I
        apologize.

2007-02-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.in: fix bug 407480 to prevent "orca --help" and
        other information-only command lines option from killing other
        Orca processes.

2007-02-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: don't use uppercase voice for strings such
        as "2:40 AM".  This merely involved checking to make sure a
        string was isupper ("2:40 AM" matches that) and isalpha ("2:40 AM"
        fails that).

2007-02-13  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py:
          Fix for bug #405624 - Orca failed to report the label if it was
          same as previous one.

2007-02-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: add a little more logic to onSameLine.
        It now says objects are on the same line if: 1) their base
        lines are within 11 pixels and 2) their bounding rectangles
        at least touch top/bottom.  This seems to help a lot with
        pages with really small fonts.

2007-02-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/planning.ods: update to include bugs as of this morning

2007-02-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: added new bugs.  Also did some reformatting
        by hand to make this easier to edit by hand.  Don't edit this
        file with a WSYWIG editor.  Those things don't like people.

        * bugs/bugs.html: update based upon bugs that have been fixed.
        Still need to roll in a slurry of news ones that are hanging
        in my inbox.  I also reformatted this file using 'nvu'.  It
        gave us a little bit of hand-editability back.

2007-02-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for v2.17.91.

2007-02-11  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Handle the new implementation of
        comboboxes that the Firefox guys made as part of the fix
        to Mozilla bug #363955.

2007-02-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/planning.ods: replace planning.html with planning.ods.

2007-02-11  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/settings.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
        src/orca/script.py, src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py: Fix for
        bug #397787: Orca non-responsive if OOo goes into recovery
        mode.  Since we seem to want/need different values for
        commFailureAttemptLimit, pull it out of settings.py and make
        it script-specific.

2007-02-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py: update to support latest BrlAPI.

2007-02-07  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Additional change for
        bug #405541 - regression: Braille stopped showing message
        header from beginning of row. Defers text field autocompletion
        handling to braillegenerator.BrailleGenerator.
        Gecko._getBrailleRegionsForText does not return the correct
        autocompletion for Thunderbird. This needs to be further
        investigated, but this fix works in the mean time.

        The additional change was to directly call
        braillegenerator.BrailleGenerator.__getBrailleRegionsForText
        instead of repeating the logic in Thunderbird.py

2007-02-07  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Fix for bug #405562 -
        regression: Braille autocompletion in Thunderbird compose
        dialog stopped working

2007-02-07  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Fix for bug #405541 -
        regression: Braille stopped showing message header from
        beginning of row

2007-02-07  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py, src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
        Part fix and part hack for bug #363830.  Now Orca is much
        more likely to announce when bold, underline, italics, and
        the various alignment toggle buttons change state in OOo.
        Should this fail, the work-around is to give any flat review
        command which will cause us to start getting the needed events.

2007-02-05  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Additional fix for
        Bug #403767 - Orca does not speak Thunderbird autocompetions.
        Orca no longer speaks the role "autocomplete".

2007-02-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/planning.html: first pass at prioritization of tasks.

2007-02-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py, src/orca/mag.py: allow the magnifier to
        better track the cursor in Firefox.

2007-02-03  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * orca.spec.in: add libgail-gnome dependency.

2007-02-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: remove progress bar visibility hack to
        determine when a page is loading now that the Firefox folks
        have fixed the busy state event notification on the document
        frame.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py, src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: prevent
        Thunderbird from saying "Finished loading.".

2007-02-02  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Fixed #Bug 403767 - Orca
        does not speak Thunderbird autocompetions

2007-02-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/acss.py, src/orca/orca-setup.glade,
        src/orca/orca_prefs.py, src/orca/speech.py,
        src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: fix for bug 398531 to better handle
        the population of the speech preferences tab.

2007-02-01  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Fixed problem with
        not speaking the message header when "View Message Pane"
        is disabled.

2007-02-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          Fix for bug #380050 - New window should be focused after user
          presses "Quit" or "Preferences" button in Orca Preferences
          window. Thanks to Joanie for extensively testing this.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
          Work on bug #400763 - Orca hangs after starting the update
          process in update manager. Checked in a patch that checks to
          see whether the event.source.valid field is set or not for each
          event, in the _enqueueEvent() routine and ignores invalid events.
          We still get the initial COMM_FAILURE's when we try to access an
          invalid accessible, but overall Orca is now much more responsive
          in a situation like this.

2007-01-31  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Sets focus to the cell
        at the beginning of table rows, so Braille shows the row
        from the beginning. This is an issue for message header
        table rows, where the cell with focus is in the column
        that is sorted on (e.g., date).

2007-01-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: handle unnamed link images that end in a "/"
        a little better (we now speak the stuff just prior to the "/" in
        these cases).

2007-01-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: first pass at letting the user know when
        a page has been loaded.  There's still some verbosity that
        needs to be removed when pages take a long time to load.
        Something also seems to be a little sticky about the name
        of the page.  Need to look into this some more.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
        make sure minimumIncrement is defined when calculating
        percentages for progress bars.  Looks like Gecko doesn't
        want to give us a minimumIncrement on the value for them.

2007-01-29  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/where_am_I.py: Removed typo.

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Fixed fence-post
        error that was causing Orca to not speak the contents
        of the Notes text area in the New Contact dialog.


2007-01-29  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * src/orca/default.py: During a text-inserted event,
        if the last input event was a keyboard event, check
        for selection.  If text is selected, it's an autocomplete
        and the full field should be spoken. Fix for bug #400766
        as well as #348464.

2007-01-12  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/where_am_I.py: Fixed multiple-defined method.

2007-01-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for v2.17.90.

        * RELEASE_HOWTO: update how to "tag" a release.

        * src/orca/util.py, src/orca/where_am_I.py,
        src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: pychecker linting.

2007-01-20  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * bugs/bugs.html: Added some acroread bugs. Having read up
        on section 508, marked several acroread issues accordingly. :-)

2007-01-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: adjust how we grab focus of the object
        containing the paragraph object.  Basically, the idea is to find
        the first focusable object in the ancestry of the paragraph.  This
        typically ends up being the document frame.  Note that we're told
        this will not work in
        https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=363214, but the
        advice given there (grab focus on the parent of the document
        frame) doesn't work.  In any case, this fixes the problem with
        the missing caret.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: add option, "arrowToLineBeginning". If True,
        it tells us to position the caret at the beginning of a line when
        arrowing up and down.  If False, we'll try to position the caret
        directly above or below the current caret position.  The default
        value is True.  Note that the default value of True represents a
        new behavior.  The old behavior was to try to position the caret
        directly above or below the current caret position.  If you want
        to experiment, you can add the following lines to your
        ~/.orca/user-settings.py or ~/.orca/orca-customizations.py files:

        import orca.Gecko
        orca.Gecko.arrowToLineBeginning = False

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py, src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py,
        src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: fix for bug 397797 to expose
        and use the language attribute for speech.

2007-01-18  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Temporary Braille workaround
        for not displaying a label that follows an editable text field.
        This is another temporary workaround for Thunderbird not assigning
        a LABEL_FOR relation to the label.

2007-01-18  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Filters out unrelated
        labels that end with a colon. This is a temporary workaround
        for a Thunderbird bug, where many (all?) unrelated labels
        ending in a colon, do not have the LABEL_FOR relation set.

2007-01-18  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/bugs.html:
          Added in an entry for bug #397724 - Orca incorrect echo's
          certain input in gnome-terminal when key echo is set to off
          (on Ubuntu Feisty).

2007-01-18  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: speak blank lines.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: provide a little better navigation around
        links that are images -- the attempt here is to reduce verbosity
        and to reduce the number of keystrokes to arrow over such a beast.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: provide better braille cursor tracking in
        plain old 'static' text.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: provide better braille cursor tracking in
        link text.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: ignore empty table cells that appear to be
        there solely for layout purposes.  This helps a bit more with
        navigation.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: ignore useless images when navigating.  This
        seems to help with a number (but not all) of navigation problems.
        Still need to look at problems where we seem to get stuck on a
        line.  I suspect this has to do with small font sizes on a page.
        If you want to experiment, press Ctrl+Plus to increase the font
        size.  I've found it makes the current Orca logic work a little
        better, and I'll look to see what we can do to avoid requiring
        the user to manually increase the font size.

2007-01-17  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Added a speechgenerator
        to filter out unrelated text in the Account Settings dialog.
        Remove all static text except for text at the beginning
        of the dialog. This is what the user needs to hear when
        the dialog is first presented.

2007-01-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py: add debug to
        _getSpeechForTableCellRow so we know it has been called.  Also
        do not read entire row if the table is for layout purposes
        only -- this helps reduce the repetitive speaking of lines.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py: add debug to
        _getBrailleRegionsForTableCellRow so we know it has been called.
        Also do not read entire row if the table is for layout purposes
        only.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: rework combobox support as a result of
        fixed/changed combobox support in the Gecko AT-SPI implementation.

2007-01-16  Joanmarie Diggs <j-diggs@comcast.net>

        * bugs/bugs.html: Added an acroread section.

        * bugs/acroread_diag.py: A stand-alone python bug-reproducer.

2007-01-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: prioritize Firefox and Thunderbird bugs.

2007-01-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/default.py,
        src/orca/gnome-terminal.py: fix for bug 395749: make sure we
        reference any_data values when we get an event rather than waiting
        to work with them asynchronously.

2007-01-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: attempt to get rid of presentation of
        "useless" images.  Note that you can still navigate to these
        useless images -- I'll work on fixing that later.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: don't speak 'cell'.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: clump speech utterances together by acss
        in an attempt to avoid choppiness in speech.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: add in detection of images that are links.
        I'm not sure I like this since it only operates on images (I'd
        like for the script to handle *anything* that's in a link),
        but it is much better now than it used to be.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: move getLinkBasename to script instead of
        making it a module method (just to be a bit tidier).

2007-01-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Add code to determine the speech and braille
        for a link from the URI for the link if no other text can be
        found.  Note that more work still needs to be done for braille
        and also when these beasts are navigated to in any way other
        than tabbing to them.  It's a work in progress.

2007-01-12  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Generalized Thunderbird 3
        dialog handling (Folder Properties, Account Settings, etc.)

2007-01-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py, src/orca/Gecko.py: hackndle (hack and handle)
        the case where things in the speech context are objects that are
        not our special objects that consist solely of a single
        EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTER.  I'm going to need to bite the bullet
        at some point and handle this whole EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTER
        business.  It isn't going to be pretty.

2007-01-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        *  test/harness/runall.sh: add  info  at end  that  allows you  to
        determine  how long  the test  took (it  currently takes  about 33
        minutes on my laptop).

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/Gecko.py,
        src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py: add new
        isLayoutOnly method to default.py where isLayoutOnly returns True
        if the object is for layout/spacing purposes only. If so, don't
        add it to the speech or braille context.  The current logic looks
        for the Gecko "layout-guess" property as well as
        unlabelled/unnamed panels.  Refactor the
        get{Speech,Braille}Context methods to use this new method.  Note
        that the "layout-guess" property of Gecko is a built-in heuristic
        of Gecko and does not require specific markup in the HTML.  It
        seems to work OK and is what we seem to end up needing to use
        because I cannot figure out other ways to get things like border
        width and such out objects.

        * src/orca/at-spi.py: add 'attributes' field to Python Accessible
        and have it delegate to the getAttributes method of the AT-SPI
        Accessible object.

        * src/orca/util.py: additional fix for bug 394397: make sure
        local variables are set before being used.

2007-01-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py: In getDisplayedText, genericize the expansion
        of accessible text when the accessible text is a single
        EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTER.  This provides a little better
        experience for Gecko.  The note from my EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTER
        commit on 2007-01-09 still applies, though.

2007-01-11  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: In the Account Settings
        dialog, speak the enclosing panel if it is named.

2007-01-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py:
          Fix for bug #376791 - Orca does not provide access to the buddy
          list in Gaim 2.0.0 beta 5.

2007-01-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py: fix for bug 394397 - handle arrowing to
        the end of a line and prevent the line from being spoken again.
        This is designed to work with the getTextAtOffset implementations
        provided by at least GEdit, Gecko, and OOo.

2007-01-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * test/harness/runall.sh: add "-s" option to require test
        runner to press "Return" to go from one keystroke file to
        the next.  This is useful in helping to analyze keystroke
        files -- you can more easily kill the test harness when
        you that a test has gone awry, and you have a better idea
        of which test when awry.

2007-01-10  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Thunderbird.py: Handle preferences that
        contain editable text fields.

2007-01-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * test/harness/runall.sh: update to ignore .svn directories

        * test/2007-01-10_07:19:11/*: new test results

2007-01-09  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py:
          Fix for bug #392939 - "-" should be spoken when used as a
          negative sign at "some" punctuation.

2007-01-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: some work on comboboxes inside HTML forms.
        Note that the the combobox AT-SPI implement seems a bit broken,
        so I could only take this so far (see my bugs.html entry from
        this same day).

        * src/orca/atspi.py: if we expect to find a child, but it doesn't
        exist, make sure we raise it as a warning.  This is not good
        behavior on part of the AT-SPI implementation and we need to make
        sure we know about it so we can log a bug with the appropriate
        AT-SPI implementation.

        * src/orca/util.py: in getDisplayedText, handle case where the
        text is a single EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTER.  In these cases,
        we'll defer to getDisplayedText on the child for the text.  The
        main driver for this is the Gecko toolkit, and this is a fix
        to handle the majority of the problems I've been seeing with
        labels in Gecko.  At some point, we may need to provide a more
        sophisticated algorithm to handle strings containing one or
        more EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTERs, but we'll cross that bridge
        when we get to it.

        * bugs/bugs.html: Add Firefox/Gecko bugs 366434 (crasher) and
        366435 (combobox children disappearing from hierarchy when
        activated from keyboard).

2007-01-08  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Don't use the structural navivation
        model if the user is editing the document.

2007-01-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: add Gecko bug 366340 regarding incorrect
        value of SHOWING state on hidden list items.

2007-01-07  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * svn+ssh://wwalker@svn.gnome.org/svn/orca/tags/ORCA_2_17_5:
        final prep for v2.17.5.  Everything below this line is included
        in v2.17.5 - many many thanks to all involved.

2007-01-07  Bart Bunting <via william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/outloud.py: provide more voices and also prevent
        crash when running with ViaVoice.

2007-01-07  Joanmarie Diggs <via william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/acroread.py: address more chattiness and
        be more sensitive to string differences due to localization.

2007-01-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for v2.17.5.

        * RELEASE_HOWTO: update to include notes regarding svn.

2007-01-06  Joanmarie Diggs <via william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/acroread.py: Check to see if event.source has a
        parent before checking what the role of the parent is.  Eliminate
        some double-speaking of items in the Search panel.  Announce radio
        button state changes in the Search panel.

2007-01-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py:
          Fix for bug #393074 - Repeated characters are not correctly read.
          (Thanks to community member Juan Ramon Jimenez for this fix).

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Further work on bug #376517 - Orca does not report indentation
          in OOo Writer documents correctly. It will now speak the unit
          of measure (pixels) after the left-margin and/or right-margin
          text attributes, if they differ from the norm.

2007-01-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: use util.EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTER rather
        than making an identical local constant for it.  Also remove
        an annoying "html content" that is spoken when you navigate
        around some pages (this involved checking for ROLE_DOCUMENT_FRAME
        in getUtterancesFromContents).

2007-01-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Workaround for the problem reported in bug #376517 - Orca does
          not report indentation in OOo Writer documents correctly. The
          StarOffice.py script will now speak the text attribute
          "left-margin:" if it's different from the norm (0).

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Later that same day...
          Added "right-margin:" to the list of text attributes to check.

2007-01-04  Joanmarie Diggs <via william.walker@sun.com>

        * Add script for acroread. (NOTE from Will: This work was done
        Joanmarie's vacation.  Amazing and many thanks for your
        dedication!).

2007-01-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py: get cursor routing keys working again
        (needed to 'OR' in brlapi.KEY_TYPE_CMD for the key ranges).

2007-01-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py: update to use BrlAPI 0.5.0 Python bindings
        that have changed since December 18th.  NOTE: there is a problem
        with cursor routing keys now - we no longer seem to get the cursor
        routing key events from BrlAPI.  I have a question into the BrlAPI
        folks on this.

2007-01-03  Lynn Monsanto <Lynn.Monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/where_am_I.py: Fixed problem speaking status
        bar contents (Insert+KP_Enter) when the status bar is a
        single component (e.g., text field), rather than a container
        with multiple sub-components. #362546

2007-01-03  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          Fix for bug #347124 - Orca hangs when attempting to access apps
          started via gksu.

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          Adjusted the order of the items on the General Preferences pane.
          Keyboard layout is now first.

        * po/POTFILES.in:
          src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am:
          src/orca/scripts/liferea.py:
          Fix for bug #350233 - Orca should better support Liferea application.
          Supplied by community member Javier (thanks!)

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in an entry for gaim bug #1627333 - gaim 2.0.0beta5 buddy
          list table not accessible.

2007-01-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in an entry for atk/gail bug #387960 - Calls to
          text.getAttributeRun cause gedit to crash when running with Orca.

2007-01-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_i18n.py.in: make sure debug module is imported.

        * src/orca/orca/orca.in: do not muck with xmodmap if DISPLAY is
        not set.

2006-12-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Fix for bug #388620 New: String wrong (not not) what do you mean?

2006-12-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: make sure links are presented when they
        get focus.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: a bit more work with managing focus for the
        braille display.  Right now, a checkbox and its label are handled
        as two separate objects because they are given to us that way.  At
        some point, I'd like to join for the purposes of braille.  I'm
        still not sure if the different object for the same child problem
        is an Orca bug or a Firefox bug.  I've been trying to come up with
        sample apps to show it is a Firefox bug, but I haven't been
        successful.

2006-12-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: handle focus a little better.  This helps
        eliminate the "html container" verboseness when moving around in
        content.  Also added some code to make sure we speak something for
        things that are there when we arrow to them, but don't have any
        text (e.g., a checkbox).

        TODO: figure out why we don't set the braille cursor properly
        when looking at a set of checkboxes or when looking at the
        very first line of a text entry area.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: retool braille to use braille generators
        where possible.  Also attempt to eliminate reduncant labels.
        NOTE: I think there's a bug lurking in Firefox somewhere where it
        will give us a different accessible each time we look at the same
        child.  This is a bit disconcerting.  I'll be spending another
        half day (I've already spent about a half day on it) tracking it
        down.  In any case, the upshot of this is that it makes it very
        difficult for us to properly set the braille cursor.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: filter forms out of speech context.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: retool speech to use speech generators
        where possible.  Also attempt to eliminate redundant labels
        in speech.  I'll take a look at braille next.

        * src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 388317 - prevent crash in
        adobe acroread.

        * src/orca/default.py: fix bug 387556 - make arrowing to end
        of line in OOo consistent with what happens in gedit
        (thanks Joanie!)

        * src/orca/atspi.py: fix problem where the __main__ test was
        not working - needed to change app.role to app.getRoleName()
        (thanks Nags!)

2006-12-20  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: get caret navigation a bit back on track
        after discovering a bit of an oddity/change in the latest Firefox
        nightly.  Ah well.  Here's what I really wanted to do today:

        1) When arrowing through items in a list in a form, set their
        selected state.  Right now, you cannot select them with Orca's
        caret navigation model.

        2) Now that our display is based upon 'contents' tuples, do a
        better job displaying the contents in braille and presenting them
        in speech.  This will most likely involve pruning the contents to
        eliminate redundant content, such as labelled checkboxes and the
        labels labelling them.  I'd also like to try to hook them up to
        the speech and braille generators.

        Maybe tomorrow.  But, at least it's written down somewhere in
        case I forget and accidentally use my notes to start a fire
        in the woodstove.

        * src/orca/orca_prefs.py: fix for bug 388039 to prevent
        stack trace when running orca -t.

2006-12-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py: check to make sure a table cell
        is in a table in _getSpeechForTableCellRow.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: handle arrowing around combo boxes a little
        better (Orca wasn't even getting inside them).  The crux of the
        problem seems to be some sort of oddity with the Gecko combobox
        implementation, but I haven't nailed it down enough to file a
        bug.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Perform bulk of refactor described below.
        This simplifies the code some and makes it a bit more readable
        (I hope).  Also attempt to implement the grabFocus logic outlined
        in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=363214.  Didn't
        seem to work.  :-(

2006-12-19  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          (With help from Joanmarie Diggs -- thanks!)
          Fix for bug #382890 - Extend dynamic row and column header
          support to OOo Writer tables.

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Fix for bug #386267 - In Evolution orca should speak/braille
          the unread instead of the read status.

2006-12-18  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: reorganize methods to prepare for a minor
        refactor tomorrow.  The refactoring plan is to think of things
        as lists of [obj, startOffset, endOffset] tuples.  The speech
        functions will turns these into lists of [text, acss] tuples
        and the braille functions will turn these into lists of
        braille regions.  That's the thinking, anyway.  We'll see
        how far I get.

        NOTE: emacs code folding trick: "Ctrl+u # Ctrl+x $" will hide
        lines that start at column # or greater.  "Ctrl+x $" will put
        things back to normal.  For example, "Ctrl+u 5 Ctrl+x $" will
        compress the view to just class and method names.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: make sure that the unchecked/checked state
        of a checkbox in document content is announced when you change it.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: workaround fact that we cannot tell Gecko
        to take focus off of a text area - we just manage it via our
        own internal caret context and locus of focus.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Add ALT modifiers to keybindings (i.e.,
        say that we care about ALT and that it should not be set)
        so we do not interfere with menu mnemonics.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: make sure we use our own caret navigation
        when we are supposed to.

2006-12-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for v2.17.4.

        * src/orca/braille.py: add Write vs. WriteStruct change that
        was introduced in BrlTTY v3.8 revision 2810.

2006-12-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * configure.in: Adjust message about not finding braille.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py, src/orca/rolenames.py: a little work to allow
        you to tab into a document frame and hear something get spoken.
        Still a lot of work to do in this space.

2006-12-15  Lynn Monsanto <Lynn.Monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/util.py: Don't speak Thunderbird
        mail header column names, since it is not possible to navigate
        across the items in the table row.  #362634

2006-12-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: work on bug 385949 - prevent stack trace,
        but there's still a bug looming in Firefox:
        https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=363955

        * bugs/bugs.html: add Firefox bug 363955 regarding the above.

2006-12-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py: in getTextLineAtCaret, handle case where the
        caret is at the very end of the last line of the text.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: handle the entry portion of an autocomplete
        better.  Still need to figure out what to do when it pops up
        a menu.

2006-12-14  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Fix for bug #382418 - Orca should announce when you enter/leave a
          table in OOo Writer documents.

2006-12-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: one more try to handle
        the BrlTTY v3.8 stuff.

2006-12-13  Lynn Monsanto <Lynn.Monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/where_am_I.py: Fixed problems speaking menus
        with separator and radio buttons. #371122

2006-12-13  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Updated entries for all OOo issues.
          #71500, #72155, #69791, #72159 and #63871 all seem to be nicely
          fixed in OOo v2.1. The rest still exist.

2006-12-12  Jorge Sandín <jorges@elsendero.es>

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/keybindings.py, src/orca/orca.py,
        src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py, src/orca/orca_prefs.py,
        src/orca/orca_state.py, src/orca/settings.py: implement the ability
        to edit key bindings.

2006-12-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #384393 - Orca no longer reports bold or underline
          in OOo Writer when Insert F is pressed.

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Fix for bug #382880 - No speech output when tabbing among cells
          in OOo Writer tables.
          Fix for bug #382888 - New: Orca should announce when you cross a
          cell boundary in OOo Writer tables.
          Fix for bug #382415 - Speak cell/row setting ignored in OOo Writer
          tables.

2006-12-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py: make sure brlAPIRunning is defined
        even if BrlTTY v3.8 is not installed.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
        src/orca/braille.py: when using BrlTTY v3.8 or better,
        tell BrlTTY which braille commands we care about so we
        do not step on the interpretation of other commands.
        Also incorporate check for WINDOWPATH.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: a little more work on navigating in text
        areas.  There are so many outstanding Firefox accessibility bugs
        in the caret navigation space at the moment, though, that I have
        to admit this was pretty hard to test.

2006-12-11  Lynn Monsanto <Lynn.Monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/debug.py: Modified the
        Accessible.child(index) method to no longer throw an
        exception if self.accessible.getChildAtIndex(index)
        returns None.

        Rhythmbox incorrectly reports the number of Acccessible
        children in the "Source" table. The accessible.getChildAtIndex
        method returns None for some children. This is a non-fatal
        error since correct information is returned for all valid
        table cells.

2006-12-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in a new entry for OOo Writer issue #72470.
          [a11y] multiline paragraphs in table cells not returning correct
          accessible text information.

2006-12-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * configure.in: Add checks for BrlAPI's Python bindings.

2006-12-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/settings.py: if it exists, use the
        root window's XFree86_VT property to determine the default value
        for settings.tty (fallback to 7 otherwise).  Also add comment to
        braille.py regarding future use of WINDOWPATH if it is ever rolled
        into X.

2006-12-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py: add "tty" setting to
        allow the specification of the tty the server is running on.
        This can be set via settings.tty.  The default value is currently
        7, but this may be programmatically set to the value of the
        XFree86_VT property of the X server's root window if I can
        figure out how to do that.

2006-12-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: some initial hacking at trying to allow
        you to navigate out of text entry areas.  There's a Firefox
        bug or two in our way that prevents this from working nicely.

2006-12-08  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py

          Removed separators and table cells as large objects.

2006-12-08  Lynn Monsanto <Lynn.Monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/where_am_I.py: added support for
        speaking character attributes in where-am-I command.
        #371122


2006-12-08  Lynn Monsanto <Lynn.Monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py: speak blank lines when
        appropriate #375395


2006-12-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.in: make special concessions when running
        via gdm.  NOTE: the typical line to add to
        /etc/X11/gdm/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents is something like
        the following:

        <Control>o  1 1000 10000  /bin/sh -c "GTK_MODULES=gail:atk-bridge ctrun -l child -i none orca -n -d main-window"

2006-12-07  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: when arrowing by character, make sure that
        links get focus if one lands on them.  NOTE: if you press Enter
        to activate a link, Firefox currently scrolls the window there,
        but doesn't always move the caret.  Sigh.  I'll look at this and
        file a bug tomorrow.

        * src/orca/orca.py: add "main-window" as a feature to be enabled
        or disabled from the command line.  This allows accessible login
        to prevent the window from popping up and covering the login
        dialog.

        * src/orca/orca.py: make the {-n,--no-setup} options completely
        bypass any sense of setup, even when the gconf setting for a11y
        is false.  This allows Orca to work better with accessible login.

2006-12-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py: while I was digging around in the latest
        BrlAPI docs, I added some example code to braille.py to show
        how to underline something with dots 7+8, assuming we know what
        to underline.  Search for 'myUnderline' in the code to find
        the example.

2006-12-06  Joanmarie Diggs <via william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: fix for bug 382891 to allow flat
        review to work in the face of empty text areas.  See also
        bug 381391.

2006-12-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: don't use _("") since it
        causes a lot of bad things to happen (i.e., speak information
        about who did the translation).  The use of _("") seems to
        have snuck in as part of bug 338838.

        * src/orca/braille.py: incorporate support for the new Python
        BrlAPI bindings (the earlier stuff from BrlAPI was pre-release).
        Many thanks to Olivier BERT for his contributions here.

2006-12-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: fix for bug 382435 - only do special caret
        context management when inside HTML content.

2006-12-05  Joanmarie Diggs <via william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: fix for bug 381391 to allow flat review
        initialization to handle situations where the caret is at the end
        of a text area.

2006-12-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * test/*: make sure oowriter keystroke files quit oowriter.  Also
        check in the results of a run that finally ran beginning to end.

2006-12-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Fix for bug #382408 - Significant sluggishness when navigating
          in OOo Writer tables.

          Also added in a check for a event.source.parent != None
          that was causing a traceback as I was testing the above fix.

        * src/orca/orca_i18n.py.in:
          Fix for bug #382495 - orca --setup is not localized
          (thanks Takao!).

2006-12-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * test/*: add README and remove stray keystrokes from some
        of the *.keys files.

2006-12-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in an entry for OpenOffice Writer issue #72262:
          [a11y] Incorrect indentation value returned.

2006-12-03  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS: add new note for bug fix 319666 for v2.17.3.

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py: fix for bug 381653 to speak
        the state of a checkbox when it is changed inside a table.

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py: fix for bug 319666 to announce
          '0 items' when encountering empty tree tables, empty layered
          panes, or empty tree cells that act as tree node parents.

2006-12-02  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * test/keystrokes/gedit/newline.keys

2006-12-02  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * test/keystrokes/gtk-demo/*

          Added a note to the top of the test files

2006-12-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for v2.17.3.  I continue to be
          amazed at how much work our small team does, and I'm also
          pleased to see our small team growing with the help of recent
          contributions from community members Joanie Diggs, Jorge Sandín,
          and Javier Dorado Martínez.

2006-12-01  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * test/keystrokes/gtk-demo/*

          Added some tests and removed the ones that worn't correct.

2006-12-01  Joanmarie Diggs <via rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/find.py:
          src/orca/default.py:
          More work on bug #354463 - [requirement] "Find" command.
          - Fixed problem described in comment #13.
          - Added in laptop keyboard bindings.

2006-12-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          In the callback for the Cancel button on the Orca Preferences
          window, the code has been adjusted to destroy that window, so
          that the next time the user displays the Preferences dialog,
          all of the settings will reflect the current running state
          rather than how the user left the GUI components before hitting
          the Cancel button.

2006-11-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/find.py:
          Fixups:
          - self.debugLevel should default to debug.debugLevel
          - Only print out final location variable, if not None.
          - Removed unwanted commented out section.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          With Joanie, we fixed the find problem in comment #18 of bug #354463.

2006-11-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: final review and priority ordering of OOo bugs.

2006-11-30  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

          src/orca/where_am_I.py:

        Fixed problems with laptop binding and "where am I" #371122.

          src/orca/settings.py:
          Fix for bug #354463 - [requirement] "Find" command.

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in an entry for OpenOffice Writer issue #72155:
          [a11y] OOo v2.0.4 oowriter goes into error recovery mode when
          Orca does a find operation.

2006-11-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: review and rough priority ordering of OOo bugs.

2006-11-29  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/where_am_I.py:

        Implemented more "where am I" functionality, including
        support for orca-key and double-clike (#371122).

2006-11-29  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * test/keystrokes/gnome-terminal/edit-profiles.keys,
        test/keystrokes/gnome-terminal/simple.keys: make these work a
        little better by shortening the amount of time some keys were held
        down (they started autorepeating when we didn't want them to).

        * test/keystrokes/oowriter/menus.keys,
        test/keystrokes/oowriter/open-file.keys: make sure oowriter actually
        exits at the end of the test

        * test/keystrokes/gedit/wordecho.settings,
        test/keystrokes/gedit/printableecho.settings: add new settings
        files to ensure word and key echo are enabled when we want them to
        be enabled.

        * test/harness/runone.sh, test/harness/runall.sh: make sure
        keystroke specific settings files are actually found and used.
        Also change the location where the output is stored (make it
        dependent upon the date and time).  Also run under /tmp as a means
        to help make sure that things that expose directory names tend to
        do so consistently.

2006-11-28  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        Updates to the test harness and keystroke files.  I still have
        to get to the oowriter tests before attempting a full runall.sh,
        but I wanted to get these checked in for now.

        * test/harness/runone.sh: kill the app that was running using
        kill on its PID versus running exit.keys.

        * test/keystrokes/gedit/*, test/keystrokes/gnome-terminal/*,
        test/keystrokes/gtk-demo/*: make sure these keystroke files
        actually work.

2006-11-28  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: updates to docs and fix typos based
        upon review with Rich.

2006-11-28  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/where_am_I.py: Fixed "where am I" problems

2006-11-27  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/where_am_I.py:

        Implemented the "where am I" specification for check boxes
        through table cells bug (#371122).

2006-11-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: update docs a bit to make it easier for
        someone to come help me go on a fox hunt.

        * src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 372808: orca now reports
        the appropriate header information when tabbing between tables.

2006-11-22  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #377085 - family-name text attribute is malformed
          for multi-word family names.

        * src/orca/pronunciation_dict.py:
          Fix for bug #377955 - Suggested additions to pronunciation
          dictionary.

2006-11-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Added a line of debug to the readCharAttributes() method to
          help Padraig debug bug #377985.

2006-11-20  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in entries for two more bugs:
          - OpenOffice Framework: issue #71744.
          - atk/gail: bug #377085.

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Fix for bug #376347 - Orca should not speak new-line in the
          evolution menubar.

2006-11-18  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Change for bug #372964. Bullet-proofing added to the
          textAttrsToDictionary() method in default.py to handle
          the mal-formed family-name attribute in gaim beta2.0.0beta5
          (Ubuntu Fiesty Fawn).

          src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Fix for bug #372964 - Orca should have text-attribute settings.

2006-11-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: began looking at implementing the prev/next
        chunk functionality.  There's still a lot of logic needed to
        figure out what "next" and "previous" mean, especially when we're
        dealing with hierarchies of stuff full of
        EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTERs.

        * src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py: make sure the laptop/desktop
        choice works as expected.

        * src/orca/orca.in: add /usr/X11R6/bin to PATH so xmodmap
        can be found on Debian (I wonder if there is a better way
        to find the prefixes for where X11 binaries are installed).

2006-11-16  Jorge Sandín <jorges@elsendero.es>

        * src/orca/keybindings.py, src/orca/orca-setup.glade,
        src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: work for RFE 354970.  Adds
        a tab to the Orca preferences dialog to show the Orca
        modifier keys and the default keybindings.

2006-11-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: rework fix for bug 376002 to get the
        long options working and to add short options.

        * src/orca/orca.py: fix for bug 376002 - added command line
        features to specify use of speech/braille/mag.

2006-11-16  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * docs/doc-set/ue_input_style.sgml,
        * docs/doc-set/orca.html,
        * docs/doc-set/orca.pdf

          Slight change to the laptop keyboard layout

2006-11-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py: fix
        for bug 376006 - handle minimum increment value of 0.0 when
        calculating decimal places to present for sliders.

2006-11-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          Change for bug #358467. Mapped the time-admin to the users-admin
          script so that Orca can correctly read the table of time servers.

        * src/orca/orca.py:
          Added a line in the Orca usage message for the user preferences
          directory options.

2006-11-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: a little more poking at Craig's list as a
        test case.  Turns out that the small font size was causing issues
        with the onSameLine method.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: more work on caret navigation.  Added a
        "controlCaretNavigation" field that is False by default (False
        means to let Firefox do caret navigation, True means tell Orca to
        override caret navigation).  You can tell Orca to do caret
        navigation by adding the following lines to your
        ~/.orca/user-settings.py or ~/.orca/orca-customizations.py files:

        import orca.Gecko
        orca.Gecko.controlCaretNavigation = True

2006-11-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Fix for bug #364407 - Shift+Ctrl+T in OOCalc results in very
          verbose output. We work around presenting the really, really
          long name that the Name Box component currently has (see OOo
          issue #70955), and replace it with something much nicer.

        * src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py:
          Change for bug #373566. First sayAndPrint() for keyboard layout
          should not ask for input from user.

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          Change for bug #364529. Initial value in the Preferences Glade
          file for pitch should be 5.0 not 9.0.

2006-11-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: add preliminary "h" and "Shift+h" to
        navigate to next and previous headings.

2006-11-14  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py:
          Fix for bug #364529 - Allow voice styles (e.g., link voice) to
          be undefined. The hypertext link voice will now initially derive
          its values from the default voice settings.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Change for bug #373566. Adjusted the key bindings for laptop
          layout for "comma",
          "period" and "semicolon".

        * src/orca/scripts/users-admin.py:
          Change for bug #358467. Reverse the order that the user privileges
          table cells are spoken and brailled.

2006-11-13  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:

          src/orca/settings.py:

          src/orca/orca_prefs.py:
          src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py:
          Fix for bug #373566. Implemented the new desktop/laptop keyboard
          bindings (plus changes to the Orca Preferences dialog) per
          section 4.1 "Input Style: Keyboard Mappings" of the Orca User
          Requirements and Functional Description specification.

2006-11-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: add code to gather information about tables
        and table cells, some of which is needed to workaround bugs in
        the Firefox AT-SPI implementation (these are marked with TODO's
        that should be removed once Firefox is fixed).

2006-11-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/rolenames.py: add caption role.

        * src/orca/keybindings.py: add a little more code and logic to try
        to get keybinding support to work a little better with the Solaris
        keypad.  NumLock still presents an issue on Solaris, though.  Also
        added more documentation to say why we're looking at keycodes
        instead of keysyms.

2006-11-10  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * docs/doc-set/ue_input_style.sgml,
        * docs/doc-set/orca.html,
        * docs/doc-set/orca.pdf

          Added spec for the ability to change keyboard layouts from the GUI.

2006-11-10  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.in:
          Specifically set a $PATH for the orca script to use.
          This was needed because xmodmap lives in /usr/openwin/bin
          on Solaris.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Partial fix for bug #356060 - Provide access to tree item level
          and state in OOo Navigator.

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added two new OpenOffice bugs:

          - Issue #71430 (Writer)
            [a11y] In the Navigator window, the labels in the tree table
            should have a RELATION_NODE_CHILD_OF relation provided.

          - Issue #71431 (Presentation)
            [a11y] No apparent way to navigate to the presentation layout
            area using the keyboard.

        * src/orca/orca.in, src/orca/orca.py: fix for bug 373381 to allow
        the Caps Lock key to be used as the Orca modifier.

          Updates to specs for keyboard layout
          To include a laptop layout

2006-11-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/{acss.py,dectalk.py,espeechfactory.py,outloud.py}:
        make sure the author attribution is T. V. Raman.

2006-11-09  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added two new OpenOffice bugs:

          - Issue #71383 (Writer)
            [a11y] Default style and font name text attributes are not
            provided.

          - Issue #71385 (Writer)
            [a11y] Numerous text attributes not provided.

          and removed one:

          - Issue #71354 (Presentation):
            [a11y] No apparent way to keyboard navigate to list of
            Presentation [Backgrounds] in Presentation Wizard.

          which isn't a bug.

2006-11-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/doc-set/*.sgml: make sure all chapters and sections
        have ids so chunkified db2html will produce consistent
        files and URLs.

        * docs/doc-set/docbook-utils.dsl: new stylesheet to
        enable use-id-as-filename to work with the above.  The
        command to use this stylesheet is:

          db2html -d docbook-utils.dsl#html orca.sgml

        This will produce a large number of files in the orca
        subdirectory, each of whose filename matches the id
        tag in the sgml file.

        * docs/doc-set/orca.html: redirect to docs/doc-set/orca/orca.html
        so we don't need to keep doing a copy of orca/orca.html.

        * docs/doc-set/orca/orca.html: the default file that is output
        by db2html --nochunks orca.sgml.

        * src/orca/default.py: add defensive code to not announce name
        changes for objects who tell us their name has changed, but it
        really hasn't.  This represents the Orca-side of the fix for
        http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=353432.

2006-11-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added entries for three new OpenOffice bugs:
          - Issue #71354 (Presentation):
            [a11y] No apparent way to keyboard navigate to list of
            Presentation [Backgrounds] in Presentation Wizard.

          - Issue #71355 (Presentation):
            [a11y] No "focus" event given when going from the first to
            the second screen in the Presentation wizard.

          - Issue #71360 (Word Processor):
            [a11y] Unable to detect misspelled words.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
          More work on bug #363815 - Implement the ability to have
          application specific settings. These app specific settings
          are now only loaded when orca_state.activeScript changes.

2006-11-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: a little more work regarding when to take
        EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTER into account when presenting HTML content
        via speech and braille.

2006-11-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

          specific settings.

2006-11-07  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: fix for bug 364452 - make sure orca's
        name shows up as "orca" and not "-c" in at-poke.

2006-11-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/doc-set/ue_requirements.sgml: SGML-ize the "Where am I"
        and Firefox sections.

2006-11-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py, src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/default.py,

        src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py, src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py,

        util.py:getTextLineAtCaret returns [string, caretOffset, startOffset]
        (thanks for the comment, Lynn!)

2006-11-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for v2.17.2.

2006-11-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: provide say sayCharacter, sayWord, and sayLine
        methods that deal better with the EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTER model
        of Gecko.  Also add several roles to skip when getting the speech
        context.  These include PARAGRAPH, LIST, LIST_ITEM, etc.

        * src/orca/default.py: use hyperlink voice if object is a link
        (NOTE TO MIKE: I know you don't like this, and we have an RFE
        to not use the hyperlink voice.  However, we need to make sure
        we use it if it is defined.  When we address the RFE, we'll
        address this.)

2006-11-03  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gcalctool.py:
          Fix for bug #369292 - gcalctool doesn't speak the new result when
          the "=" button is activated.

2006-11-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: put 'vi' navigation back in place by
        default.

        * bugs/*, test/html/bugzilla_top.html: add another HTML test
        file and include some more bugs logged against Firefox.

        * test/html/textattributes.html, test/html/lists.html,
        test/html/tables.html, test/html/htmlpage.html: some
        testing pages.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: allow easy switching between 'vi' and
        arrow key navigation.  Mostly for debugging purposes.

2006-11-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py:
          src/orca/orca_prefs.py:
          src/orca/settings.py:
          Fix for bug #337063 - Provide the ability to specify an alternate
          .orca location.

2006-11-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/rolenames.py: fix speech/braille for "heading" (the
        two were accidentally swapped).

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: more work on navigating and trying to
        figure out what to speak.  It's awful at the moment, both
        in what is said and how the navigation works.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: replace 'vi' style navigation of content
        with arrow keys.  NOTE TO ANYONE READING THIS LOG: SUPPORT FOR
        GECKO IS STILL NOT WORKING AND IS NOT READY FOR COMMENT.  YOU
        WILL BE NOTIFIED THE VERY INSTANT IT IS EVEN REMOTELY READY.

2006-11-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Fix for bug #365939 - When reading the evolution messsage list, the
          check boxes should be replaced with meaningful concise information.

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          Added line to map vte application to the gnome-terminal script
          (see bug #353422).

2006-11-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: more workaround for bug
        368626 to prevent gnome-panel from crashing - add some defensive
        code to work in the case where there is no event source.

2006-10-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: workaround for
        bug 368626 to prevent gnome-panel from crashing when a
        tooltip is popped up by gnome-panel.  This merely ignores
        any events from tool tips.

2006-10-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: more work on current/previous/next line for
        tables.  Still has issues that need to be resolved regarding
        numbered list items.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: more work on current/previous/next line.
        Still has issues that need to be resolved regarding tables.

2006-10-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: work on current/previous/next line.  Still
        has issues that need to be resolved.

2006-10-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in an entry for OpenOffice bug #71010:
          [a11y] OOo doesn't implement the MEMBER_OF relation for radio buttons.

2006-10-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fixed an "Index out of range" problem found while investigating
          bug #356066. Problem was in _getBrailleRegionsForComboBox() in
          braillegenerator.py.

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in entries for the six new OOo bugs that have recently
          been opened.

2006-10-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: add code to get current word at caret context
        and also code to go to next/previous word.  Not hooked up to speech
        or braille yet.  Next on to do list is next/previous line.

2006-10-27  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py
        * src/orca/orca_state.py

          Lynn's fix for bug 338838.

2006-10-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: more hacking to get leaf nodes that seem
        to be showing something, but don't implement accessible text.

2006-10-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: more hacking in the area of navigating the
        document hierarchy.  After flushing out a few AT-SPI
        implementation bugs in Firefox, I think I finally got a handle on
        this.  Will work some more utility methods next and then start on
        implementing Mike's navigation scheme written up at
        http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/orca/docs/doc-set/orca.html#UROFFICEAPPS.

2006-10-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/users-admin.py:
          More work on bug #358467 - Orca doesn't read check items status
          in Users and groups dialog of Gnome. Added in braille support
          (previous fix only handled speech).

        * Fix for bug #355733 - Function "Say all" doesn't work correctly
          in Openoffice writer.
          This fix includes removing the caching of relation sets. If we
          find that this is a performance, there might be some fine tuning
          that can be done. See comment #11 of the bug for more details.

2006-10-25  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am:
          src/orca/scripts/users-admin.py:

          Users and groups dialog of Gnome.

2006-10-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: handle menus a little better in Firefox;
        menus were being skipped in flat review since they don't implement
        the accessible text interface.

2006-10-25  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * docs/doc-set/ue_requirements.sgml,
        * docs/doc-set/orca.html,

          Updates to requirements for firefox.

2006-10-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: don't set locus of focus to None in
        onStateChanged - it was wreaking havoc on the context code
        to let you know when you tabbed between panels.  Verified
        the fixes for bugs 361670 and 355893 still work.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
        add SECTION as a role to skip for context, and also do not
        use both label and name in speech for an object if they are
        both identical (we were getting bad repeats in Firefox for
        this).

        * src/orca/rolenames.py: add SECTION, FORM, and LINK roles.

2006-10-24  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          Fix for bug #363831 - Provide an option to reverse the whereAmI
          information.

          Updates to requirements

2006-10-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: work on getting previous character.  Adjust
        caret context on caret moved event.  Add debug code to draw a
        rectangle around the character we're looking at.

2006-10-23  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/pronunciation_dict.py:
          Changed all occurances of __pronunciation_dict to
          pronunciation_dict. A user might want to add/change
          entries in the pronunciation dictionary via their
          ~/.orca/orca-customizations.py file, therefore the
          name should not indicate that this dictionary was
          module private.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Fix for bug #364086 - Orca reports "paragraph 0 paragraph"
          <char> when you begin typing in a Calc cell.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Another slight adjustment to an "Item x of y" line in the
          whereAmI() method to make it more easily localizable.

          Updates to requirements

2006-10-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: add Firefox bug
        https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=357625 regarding
        broken getTextAtOffset implementation.

        * src/orca/util.py, src/orca/flat_review.py, src/orca/default.py,
        src/orca/script.py: more work on bug 355525.  Move flat review
        context creation logic out of default.py and into flat_review.py.
        Move global flat_review helper methods into flat_review Context
        class and provide knowledge of script in the flat_review Context
        to give the flat_review the ability to use script-specific helper
        functions.  Also allow the flat_review Context class to be used by
        a script to be overridden.  The default is in script.py:
        self.flatReviewContextClass = flat_review.Context.

2006-10-22  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Slight fixups for bug #363807
            - item number was off by one.
            - adjustment of text line to make it more easily localizable.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Slight adjustment for bug #363801 - column number now spoken
          as column letter(s).

2006-10-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am:
          src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py:
          src/orca/pronunciation_dict.py:
          src/orca/util.py:
          Fix for bug #321184 - Need a pronunciation dictionary.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Fix for bug #363802 - When navigating in Calc from cell to cell,
          Orca should not say "cell".

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #363807 - Orca should report the quantity of items
          in a table.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/orca.py:
          src/orca/util.py:
          Fix for bug #363796 - In learn mode, the second press of a letter
          should provide the phonetic.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Fix for bug 363801 - Provide confirmation when the user presses
          Insert R/C in Calc.

2006-10-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: a bit of work to better handle the
        unicode EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTER method used by Firefox (and
        maybe OpenOffice) to indicate nesting of textual components.  The
        main thing was to honor the accessible text of non-leaf nodes and
        also take care if they had EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTERs in them.
        Still not all the way there yet, but it is getting better.  BTW,
        this fixes the "32 bugs found" issue of bug 355525, but there's
        still issues with the other test case - flat review doesn't seem
        to find all the text on that page.  Still looking.

2006-10-20  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: fix keynames.keynames reference in learn
        mode - use keynames.getKeyName instead.  This was something
        introduced as a result of fix for bug 349954.

2006-10-20  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Updated the table entry for three of the OpenOffice bugs
          after testing with SO build m186.

        * src/orca/util.py:
          Fix for bug #357063 - Special case consideration for "repeat
          character count" functionality.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug 344249 - Orca should report menu mnemonics.

2006-10-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: more work on in order traversal ideas.

2006-10-19  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          Fix for bug #348975 - orca should not speak the role when moving
          between radio buttons.

        * src/orca/scripts/gnome-panel.py:
          src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am:
          Fix for bug #363423 - Orca will not provide access to the
          Applications menu if in a Gaim chat window

        * docs/pydoc/Makefile.am:
          po/POTFILES.in:

          adjusted all the scripts that need to turn this off.

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          Reverse the order back for state and role utterances for check boxes.

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          src/orca/atspi.py:
          Added a new setting in settings.py called useBlockPreventor (default
          of False) which determine whether we create a gobject idle handler.
          This seems to nicely fix bug #349956 - Orca causes gedit Print
          Dialog to slow down.

2006-10-18  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: fix for bug 363242 -
        handle odd application name changing behavior of yelp so it can
        still be seen as the active script after it changes its name
        and id.

        * src/orca/settings.py: add a mapping from 'yelp' to 'Mozilla' to
        be sure it picks up the Mozilla script.  Part of fix for bug
        363242.

          Updates to requirements

2006-10-18  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py:
          Fix for bug #361624 - Flat review sometimes fails to move to second
          column of text in OOo Writer documents.

2006-10-18  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: update and colorize (green means fixed, yellow
        means fix available for us to test).  Also prioritized the OOo
        section.

2006-10-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: add throw away code to navigate character
        by character from the beginning of the document frame.  The code
        is very rough, not complete, undocumented, and just experimental.
        The real form will take shape once we have a better understanding
        of what the user interface design will be.

        * bugs/bugs.html: add Mozilla bug:
        https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=357032

        * src/orca/default.py: fix bug 357829 - use real active descendant
        of a table cell when looking for locus of focus in flat review.

2006-10-17  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gnome-search-tool.py:
          src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am:
          Fix for bug #341406 - Orca does not present results when finding
          files.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py:
          Fix for bug 319783 - Orca should speak/braille the insensitive
          states of objects if they are insensitive.

2006-10-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py: use writeStruct with new BrlAPI Python
        bindings.  This helps address bug 338111 regarding displaying
        accents correctly (I hope!).

        * src/orca/braille.py: use the official BrlAPI Python bindings
        if they exist.  NOTE: this may change since the official BrlAPI
        bindings have not been released yet.

2006-10-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/util.py:
          New fix for bug #355893. It no longer breaks the fix for
          bug #361670. Thanks to Joanie for this.

        * src/orca/script.py:
          src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          src/orca/scripts/gaim.py:
          src/orca/scripts/metacity.py:
          Fix for bug #348693 - Evolution announcement of new mail should
          be togglable.
          This also fixes bug #357169 - Text output in terminal shouldn't
          be announced if gnome-terminal is not focused.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Revised fix for bug #354460. Review previous or next character
          should not have been doing a phonetic spell if clicked three
          times.

2006-10-14  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Took out the "fix" for bug #355893. It breaks the fix for
          bug #361670.

2006-10-14  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
          Combined fix from myself, Will and Joanie for bug #361670 - Flat
          reviewing immediately after minimizing Orca main window fails.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Combined fix from myself and Will for bug #355893 - Network
          Preferences - Port label will not be reported by orca.

2006-10-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for v2.17.1.

        * docs/pydoc/Makefile.am, po/POTFILES.in, src/orca/Makefile.am:
        make the alphabetization of things consistent across files to
        make it easier to check if we've missed something or not.

2006-10-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Staroffice.py: more work on enhancement 361167
        to allow column 0 and row 0 to be headers.

2006-10-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/debug.py,
        src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py, src/orca/orca_prefs.py,
        src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/speechserver.py: use the Python
        logging API to log speech and braille output at the INFO level.

2006-10-13  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Staroffice.py:
          Further work on enhancement #361167.
          Reversed Insert-r and Insert-c hot-keys and improved the wording
          of the "help" for learn mode for these two hot-keys.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Fix for bug #350219 ? In OOo, no announcement when you create a
          new document. Adjusted clause #1 of the locusOfFocusChanged()
          methods such that if the old locus of focus was on the
          File->New->Text Document menu item and we are currently have
          focus on an empty text paragraph, then we've just created the
          first new text document in Writer. Announce it by doing a
          "where am I".

2006-10-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: Add experimental debug code to start walking
        the document in an in-order fashion.

2006-10-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py: add ability to obtain hyperlink specialization

        * src/orca/atspi.py: add fallback mechanism to determine string
        for role for LINK and INPUT_METHOD_WINDOW - these strings somehow
        didn't make it into the atk implementation (bug filed as
        http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=361757).

        * src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/rolenames.py: add LINK, HEADING,
        INPUT_METHOD_WINDOW, ENTRY, and DOCUMENT_FRAME roles that were
        recently added to the AT-SPI infrastructure.

2006-10-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Staroffice.py:
          Further work on enhancement #361167.
          > The dynamic column header is only announced if you change
            columns (similar for rows).
          > Implementation confused what was row headers and what was
            column headers. They have now been reversed.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug 361747 - Orca should use weight to determine if
          text is bolded in OO writer and calc.

2006-10-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        src/orca/scripts/gnome-window-properties.py,
        src/orca/scripts/planner.py: provide speech and braille
        generators with the knowledge of a script so they can use
        script methods, such as delegating to the getText method.
        Also fixed the StarOffice.py getText method to take an
        endOffset of -1 into account.

2006-10-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Staroffice.py:
          Further work on enhancement #361167.
          The StarOffice.py scripts now subclasses
          _getBrailleRegionsForTableCellRow and _getSpeechForTableCellRow,
          so that we can braille/speak the dynamic headers (if present)
          only once per row, per the rules of how headers should be read.

2006-10-10  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Staroffice.py:
          Implemented enhancement #361167 - Add dynamic row and column
          header support in Orca for StarOffice/OpenOffice calc. See the
          Orca User Requirement specification for more details.

2006-10-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: add ZONE support for goBegin and goEnd
        functions (thanks Joanie!).

2006-10-09  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * test/harness/runall.sh:
          Fix for bug #359919 - Changes needed to the Orca Test Harness.
          Adjusted the runall script to check to see if the application
          exists.
          If it does, then supply that as a $2 parameter to the runone.sh
          command.
          If it doesn't exist see if the name is in a list of system types
          that we care about (currently "SunOS" and "Linux").
            If it is, then compare the directory name against the result of
            running `uname`.
              If they match, then run the scripts in that directory.
              If they don't match, ignore that directory.
            If it isn't, then don't supply a $2 parameter to the runone.sh
            command.

          test/keystrokes/SunOS:
          test/keystrokes/Linux:
          Created empty directories for operating system specific
          keystroke tests.

        * src/orca/scripts/gedit.py:
          Fix for bug #319657 - Orca should speak 'find' command new line.
          See the comments in the script for more details.

2006-10-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Implemented enhancement #339789 - Orca should report the quantity
          of menu and submenu. Added code to the whereAmi method so that if
          this is a normal, check or radio menu item or a menu within a
          menu, give its position within the menu and the total number of
          menu items in the parent menu.

2006-10-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/chnames.py: add some mathematical symbols

        * src/orca/scripts/gcalctool.py: fix for bug 350523 - give
        preference to accessible name of a button over the text that is
        being displayed on a button.

2006-10-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Adjusted the merging of charDict into allAttributes in the
          readCharAttributes() method. This now speaks the character
          attributes in StarOffice Writer.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py:
          src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Fix for bug #354785 - "Process Fields" preferences table in

        * src/orca/scripts/gnome-terminal.py:
          Fix for bug #355602 - $ gets echoed twice in terminal with word
          echo enabled. Fix was to only call echoPreviousWord() if the
          last keyboard event from the user matches the last character

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py: fix bug 359324 - problem that
        fell out as a result of the script.getText refactor.

        * src/orca/default.py: fix bug 357150 - use 'append' instead of
        'extend' to avoid spelling out the 'No focus' message.

        * src/orca/settings.py: add bug-buddy as a mapping to gnome_segv2.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: more work on presenting the various styles
        and implementations of combo boxes and text entry fields in Gecko.
        Quite challenging.

2006-10-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * po/POTFILES.in: add braille.py, Gecko.py, phonnames.py

        * src/orca/default.py: add isTextArea method to determine if an
        object is a text area or not.  This allows us to deal with the
        growing number of things that are text areas, but choose to give
        themselves different roles (e.g., GTK's 'text', OpenOffice's
        'paragraph', and Gecko's 'entry').

          > Added a new setting in setting.py:

          has one setting at the moment: a checkbox that indicates whether
          the Orca main window should be shown (default is yes). Adjusted
          the Orca code to use this new preferences setting.

          Fix for bug #351569 - Orca does not provide access to Unlock
          Keyring dialog in Evolution 2.7.
          Similar fix to bug #344192. Created a gnome-keyring-ask.py script
          that subclassed the locusOfFocusChanged() method and set the old
          locus of focus to None before calling locusOfFocusChanged() in
          default.py.

2006-09-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am:
          src/orca/scripts/gnome_segv2.py:
          Fix for bug #344192 - Orca doesn't report on "Application has
          unexpected crashed" dialogs. Added in a new gnome_segv2.py
          script and overrode the locusOfFocusChanged() method. If the
          gnome_segv2 application is running it's probably because
          some application has crashed unexpectedly. If we just called
          locusOfFocusChanged() in default.py we would hang. To
          circumvent this, we set the old locus of focus to None, then
          we can safely call the locusOfFocusChanged() method in default.py.

2006-09-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: reverse engineer and handle Gecko's unique
        way of managing combo boxes.

        * src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 358508 - use obj instead
        of event.source in visualAppearanceChanged for speech.

2006-09-29  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Gecko.py: incorporate labelled panels into the speech
        context.  This helps us know when we move between labelled panels
        in the preferences dialogs.

        work as part of partial fix for bug 356425 - make sure all scripts
        call self.getText instead of calling getText directly on an
        object's text specialization.

2006-09-28  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/J2SE-access-bridge.py:
        Fix for bug #353532 - [blocked] popup menu items not presented
        in java applications. This is a workaround for a java-access-bridge
        bug (Bug 355011) where popup menu events are not sent to Orca.
        When a root pane gets focus, a popup menu may have been invoked.
        If there is a popup menu, give locus of focus to the armed menu
        item.

2006-09-28  Lynn Monsanto <lynn.monsanto@sun.com>

        * src/orca/keybindings.py:
          src/orca/J2SE-access-bridge.py:
          Fix for bug #353531 - checked'/'unchecked' reported twice
          for check boxes in java applications. A new method,
          onValueChanged, was added to J2SE-access-bridge.py to ignore
          the value-changed event when a checkbox is checked or unchecked.
          The _getKeycode method in keybindings.py was modified to include
          a test for the keyval returned by gtk.gdk.keyval_from_name(keysym).
          _getKeycode returns 0 if gtk.gdk.keyval_from_name(keysym) returns
          0. This prevents an assertion failure in
          keymap.get_entries_for_keyval(keyval) when keyval is 0.

          keystroke files. The hot-key to start/stop recording of
          keystrokes within Orca has been reverted to just "Pause".
          Also adjusted the "don't write pause keystrokes" code to

          keyboard).

        * src/orca/braille.py: add command_name dictionary from Jorge Sandin
        as partial work on 354970 (thanks Jorge!).

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py: partial fix
        for bug 356425 - prevent Orca from restarting when dealing with bad
        implementations of accessible text.  This is done by creating a
        "getText" method for the script that will delegate to the getText
        method of the text specialization for an object.  The StarOffice
        implementation overrides this new method to handle the delegation
        in a different way.  NOTE that another part of the bug is still
        valid, but it is blocked by a bug in the way OOo handles caret
        movement around bullets and other multibyte UTF-8 strings.

        * src/orca/braille.py: use unicode type to determine string length
        in characters (versus bytes).

        * src/orca/brlmon.py, src/orca/util.py: trap for UTF-8 conversion
        errors.

        * src/orca/util.py: in speakTextSelectionState, look at characters
        using unicode string instead of UTF-8 string.  When looking at them
        as UTF-8 string, we had the problem of looking at single bytes of
        multibyte characters.

        * bugs/bugs.html: add OpenOffice bug 69945 regarding byte offsets
        versus character offsets in accessible text implementation.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py, src/orca/Makefile.am,
        src/docs/pydoc/Makefile.am, src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py: provide
        a new toolkit script module (Gecko.py) to help keep us from
        having to keep updating the script mappings each time Firefox
        decides to change its name (the toolkit name remains constant
        as 'Gecko', but the application name keeps changing).  The Mozilla
        script is now currently a mere simple subclass of Gecko.

        * src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py: the Gecko toolkit has a habit of
        intermingling frame focus events with menu focus events when one
        moves from menu to menu.  In particular, oddities seem to happen
        when one moves between the History<->Bookmarks<->Tools menus.
        The Mozilla script had a check to ignore focus events on frames,
        but FF3 seems to have added a new "document frame" role type, so
        we now ignore that as well.

        byte-by-byte.

          More work on bug #354469 - Repeated character count.
          This seems to be working nicely now, so I've adjusted the

          settings.repeatCharacterLimit = 4

          src/orca/default.py:
          Added in support for the repeated character count for the
          whereAmI() and sayAll() functions.

          src/orca/default.py:
          Also adjusted _addRepeatSegment() to not do the repeated

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/settings.py:
          Work on bug #354469 - Repeated character count.
          The "repeat character count" option should be enabled for all
          the scenerios above except:

            Numpad++     - default.sayAll
            Numpad+Enter - default.whereAmI

          By default, I've set the repeat character count to zero. I.e:

            settings.repeatCharacterLimit = 0

          This is until it has been fully tested and we've made sure that
          it's doing what is required.

          To enable it, just add the following line to your
          ~/.orca/user-settings.py file:

            orca.settings.repeatCharacterLimit = 4

          Double-click will continue to ordinarily spell the

        * test/harness/runall.sh:

            -h|--help          - print a usage message.
            -k <keystrokesDir> - alternate keystroke directory
                                 (default is ../results).
            -r <resultsDir>    - alternate results directory
                                 (default is ../keystrokes).

        First part of the automated regression testing changes.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fixed up keystroke recording hot-key binding to be
          Insert-Pause (not Pause).

        * tests/harness/runall.sh:
          - Removed the F12.py lines. When the orca script now starts, it
            will automatically attempt a cleanup of any previously running
            orca commands.
          - Removed the "-maxdepth 1" option from the find commands. There
            is no such option with the find command on Solaris.
          - Adjusted the find command at line 41 to use '-name "*.keys"',
            because there will now be other files in the same directory.
          - Removed the 'which application' (i.e. never pass in a $2, so
            that gnome-terminal will be started by the runone.sh script).

        * tests/harness/runone.sh:
          - If a <testfilename>.settings file exists, should use that
            instead of the default user-settings.py.in.
            We still need to run sed on it, to adjust the debug filename
            and create a user-settings.py file in the /tmp directory.
          - Commented out the event listener stuff for now.
            (We can possibly improve on this later.)
          - Adjusted line 28 to add an "else" clause to start
            gnome-terminal if there was no $2 supplied.
          - Terminate what ever was started ($2 or gnome-terminal)
            and Orca (with "orca --quit").

        * tests/harness/user-settings.py.in:
          Adjusted to contain the initial current set of settings (as
          created by "orca --text-setup", but also set the speech factory
          to None, and removed all the other speech settings.

        better fallback algorithm to find a working synthesis engine.

2006-08-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/scripts/gedit.py:
          Refixed bug #350854 - Orca should handle object:state-changed:focus
          events (thanks Will).
          Fix for bug #353268 - Orca is double reading lines in OpenOffice

        * src/orca/orca.in, src/orca/orca.py: apply modified patch to
        partially fix bug 352866 - add "-q" and "--quit" options to allow
        one to more easily kill running Orca processes.  Supplied by
        community member Javier (thanks!)

        Prevent wrong object report for java applications in case of different
        event ordering (Fix for bug #352240).
        * src/orca/util.py:
        Improved isSameObject() function: in case of getting different objects
        that point to same logical child (for children of objects that manage
        their descendants), we examine the hierarchy and the object index
        at each level to see if two objects point to the same child.

          Updates to the requirements guide.

2006-08-18  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.in: bypass the watchdog and backgrounding of orca
        if arguments are to be used or if accessibility has not been
        enabled.  This permits the text-based setup option of orca to run
        in the foreground.

        * src/orca/mag.py: add latent support to allow the setting of the
        source and target displays for magnification.  If it exists,
        settings.magnifierTargetDisplay will be treated as an X Window
        System DISPLAY string (e.g., ":0.1") that says where to display
        the magnified area (the default is split screen magnification on
        the primary display).  If it exists,
        settings.magnifierSourceDisplay will be treated as an X Window
        System DISPLAY string (e.g., ":0.0") that says what is to be
        magnified.

        * src/orca/util.py: fix for bug 351847 - defensive code in the
        event the AT-SPI implementation gives us a cycle when looking
        at the RELATION_NODE_CHILD_OF relation.

2006-08-18  Oana Serb <os@baum.ro> and Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 351891 - provide better
        handling when receiving an active descendant changed for
        an object with no active descendant.

2006-08-18  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.in: also exit on a SEGV.  The reason for this is
        that there are cases where Python will SEGV when Orca attempts to
        exit normally.  This happens because of something going on in
        pyorbit.  This should be fixed in pyorbit 2.14.1, but not everyone
        has that.  So...we'll check for it.

2006-08-18  Oana Serb <os@baum.ro>

        * src/orca/J2SE-access-bridge.py:
        Fix for bug #350740: report combo box selection change for

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py:
          Fixed the fix for bug #351501. Was generating a traceback.

        * src/orca/orca.in
          With help from Laca and Will, we've reworked the main Orca
          shell script so that:
          > the wget command now works on Solaris.
          > Control-C will kill it and its subprocesses.
          > "kill -QUIT <orca shell script pid>" will do the same.
          > "kill -HUP <orca shell script pid>" will restart Orca
            (at least on Linux. Bug #351826 has been filed for the
             problem of this not working on Solaris).

2006-08-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py: fix for bug 350213 - defensive

          message in the message header summary list is deleted.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py:

        * src/orca/speech.py: OOPS!  Fix loop logic mistake I made
        when making the change to allow us to see what would be output
        even if speechServerFactory is None.  This had the bad effect
        of making the output of many things be repeated many times.

2006-08-11  Oana Serb <os@baum.ro>

        * src/orca/util.py, src/orca/J2SE-access-bridge.py,
        src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 350739 to improve list navigation
        for the Java platform.  This also adds the isSameObject method to
        util.py to check for accessible object equivalence and uses it in
        default.py.

2006-08-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 350854 - handle
        object:state-changed:focused events so Orca will recognize when
        GEdit's edit area has focus again after a maximize/unmaxmize of
        GEdit's window on GNOME 2.15/16.

        * src/orca/speech.py: for regression testing purposes, allow us to
        get what would have been spoken even if settings.speechServerFactory
        is None.

2006-08-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: fix for bug 349465 - take some
        defensive actions in the event that the AT-SPI implementation
        has implemented getTextAtOffset incorrectly (i.e., it gives
        back garbage for offsets).

2006-08-10  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:

          TypeError (orca).

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #350212. Spin Buttons only announce one change.

2006-08-07  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: fix typo made during the orca_state.py
        refactor: instead of orca_state.lastInputEvent, make it

2006-08-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          With much guidance from Will (thanks!), we've reworked the
          way that "object:selection-changed events are handled. This
          fixes bug #347691. The rework also fixes bug #345462 and
          bug #341371 in a much cleaner manner.

          This is a relatively big change. It needs to be fully tested.

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added an entry for Evolution bug #347228:
          [a11y] Evolution not always firing "object:state-changed:expanded"

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #345462. Change to processObjectEvent(). If we are
          in a menu, and we are focused and there are no selected children,
          the set the locus of focus and notify the presentation manager
          of the change.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Slight adjustment in onActiveDescendantChanged() for the fix
          for bug #341371, to call orca.setLocusOfFocus() to set the
          focus to None, rather that set it via orca_state.locusOfFocus
          directly.

2006-08-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_prefs.py: add lines to ~/.orca/user-settings.py
        that make it more convenient to turn on/off various debugging and

        * src/orca/atspi.py: use '%f' instead of '%d' to output
        configuration information for gilSleepTime.

2006-08-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #341371. Adjusted the onActiveDescendantChanged()
          routine to set orca_state.locusOfFocus to None before calling
          orca.setLocusOfFocus(), if the event.source was the same as the
          parent of orca_state.locusOfFocus.

          about indices out of bounds.

2006-08-01  Oana Serb <os@baum.ro>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py: adjust where the role is displayed

2006-07-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.in: more "shellification", making sure command
        line arguments are passed to the python process.

        * src/orca/dectalk.py, src/orca/outloud.c: convert floating point
        ACSS values to integer values to better comply with what is
        expected by the emacspeak support
        (thanks Joanmarie Diggs!).

2006-07-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py: defensive programming in the case of a
        top level window disappearing when looking for the active
        window in findActiveWindow.  Also fix misleading typo in
        getKnownApplications (it used to say orca._buildAppList when
        it should say util.getKnownApplications).

2006-07-28  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py: send traceit output to debug log file using
        debug.LEVEL_ALL.

        * src/orca/util.py: add traceit utility to help with debugging.

        * src/orca/settings.py, src/orca/atspi.py,
        src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
        add gilSleepTime setting to allow one to customize whether we use
        time.sleep or not to try to unlock/free/sidestep Python's global
        interpreter lock (GIL).  The default value is 0.00001, but if you
        set it to 0 in ~/.orca/user-settings.py, you can experiment with
        hang behavior and how time.sleep helps or hinders hangs.

        * docs/pydoc/Makefile.am: change PYTHONPATH so this will actually
        create pydocs again.

2006-07-28  Remus Draica <rd@baum.ro>

        * src/orca/default.py: only update braille using the text
        specialization if we're sure the text specialization exists.

2006-07-28  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: abort if two speech resets are
        detected in a short period of time.  This helps prevent an infinite
        loop of speech resets, which results in hangs.

        * src/orca/braille.py: fix bug 348980 - get braille cursor routing
        keys working again.

2006-07-27  Remus Draica <rd@baum.ro>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py: handle case where we can
        get window activated/deactivated events out of order.

2006-07-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py: defensive programming to verify we can actually
        get to the various specializations of an object (added try/except
        statements around calls to _narrow).

        * src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py: do not perform special menu handling
        logic in onFocus - it has been deemed to getting in the way by
        Lynn Monsanto (thanks Lynn!).

        * src/orca/orca.in: a new script for starting Orca.  This script
        is still early in development and is currently configured to just
        clean up stray processes and then run Orca once.  However, if you
        comment out the line that sets RUNONCE (note that you need to
        comment it out - setting the value to something else will not work),
        the script will attempt to do this:

            1) Clean up stray processes before starting Orca

            2) Put a watchdog process in the background to monitor the
               state of Orca.  The watchdog will cleanup stray processes
               (including orca itself) if it detects something has gone
               awry.

            3) Keep rerunning Orca on a non-zero exit status from Orca.

        Regardless of the RUNONCE configuration, the script also sets/uses
        PYTHONPATH to tell python where to find the Orca modules.  This
        is helpful for people who have installed Orca in a non-standard
        location by running autogen/configure with a prefix other than
        /usr.

        I need help from people on this script.  For example, I cannot
        figure out how to make the watchdog die when I Ctrl+C the script -
        the watchdog seems to be running in nohup mode.  In addition, we
        need to work more on the exit values from Orca.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/braille.py,
        src/orca/settings.py: use SIGALRM instead of timeouts - we get
        better stack traces from signals.

        * src/tools/repeat_play: add script to repeatedly play a
        keystrokes file while Orca is running.  This helps stress
        test Orca.

2006-07-26  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * test/keystrokes/gedit/gedit-test.keys
        * test/keystrokes/gnome-terminal/gnome-terminal.keys
          added new gedit test and gnome terminal test.

2006-07-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/httpserver.py: override log_request to avoid annoying
        log message sent to stdout for each GET, POST, etc. request.

2006-07-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Moved the entry for bug #348466 to gail (from Evolution).

          Added an entry for gnome-panel bug #341409:
          "[a11y] Orca - In the "Add to Panel" window the items in
           the table are not read."

          Added an entry for Nautilus bug #338353
          "[a11y]: Rename file in nautilus not spoken properly by
           screen reader."

          Added an entry for gconf-editor bug #342420
          "[a11y]: Orca not correctly reporting key values in gconf-editor."

2006-07-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
        src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/orca.py: add hang
        detection handlers.  These are managed via the
        settings.timeoutTime and settings.timeoutCallback properties.
        Before doing an operation that might hang, Orca will put a timer
        in place.  This timer will call settings.timeoutCallback if the
        timer expires after settings.timeoutTime seconds.  The current
        timeout callback merely aborts Orca, and the timeout is currently
        set to a pretty long time period (10 seconds).  The next step here
        is to create a script that will detect these aborts and restart
        Orca if appropriate.

        * src/orca/orca.py: add a debug.LEVEL_ALL stack dump on the
        signal handling routines to help us better understand where
        Orca is when we send it signals.

2006-07-25  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added an entry for Evolution bug #348466:
          [a11y] When in the 'subject' and 'to' lines of evolution,
          backspaced characters are not announced.

        * src/orca/scripts/gaim.py:
          After doing a Conversation->Clear Scrollback in a chat room,
          it was possible that we would receive a zero length message.
          Added some bullet-proofing to prevent a tracback when looking
          for a newline in the first character position of the
          onTextInserted() message.

2006-07-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: remove ominmous looking
        Traceback on ImportError for a script.  The specs at
        http://pydoc.org/2.4.1/exceptions.html#ImportError say it is
        issued when a module cannot be found. We don't consider this an
        error since we fallback to default.  In addition, we have an
        additional except clause to catch other errors
        (e.g., syntax and such) on import, and that clause will output a
        stack trace.  The net effect of this is that it makes debug logs
        easier to search for Tracebacks that are "real" issues we care
        about.

        * src/orca/mag.py: provide better handling of the crosswires
        and cursor in the magnifier when tracking the mouse.

2006-07-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for 0.2.7.

2006-07-24  Raivis Dejus  <orvils@gmail.com>

        * configure.in: Added "lv" (Latvian) to ALL_LINGUAS.
        * po/lv.po: Added Latvian Translation.

2006-07-23  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: ignore defunct objects
        when processing object events.  They seem to be a source of
        hangs.  Many thanks to Joanmarie Diggs for coming up with a
        test case to help find this.  The test case is to repeatedly
        show/hide a message in Evolution using Enter in the message
        list to show it and Escape on the message window to hide it.

        NOTE: I'm still not confident that this is the final fix.  The
        problem is that an object can go defunct at any time, including
        the entire time we are processing an object event.  So...we might
        try doing some magic in atspi.py to check for the defunct state
        each time any field of an accessible is referenced and throw an
        exception if we see a COMM_FAILURE or a defunct state.  The rest
        of our code should handle the exception.  If this seems like the
        right thing to do, we can brush up on our Python chops and figure
        out how to do it.

2006-07-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gaim.py: I think we finally skinned this cat.  The
        problem seems to be that the chat area would not send events
        to us unless we tickled it by examining the hierarchy.  So,
        we tickle away, but try to be efficient about it as well.

2006-07-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added an entry for Evolution bug #347964:
          "[a11y] When deleting messages in Evolution, Orca initially speaks
          the wrong tree item".

        * src/orca/gaim.py:
          Applied a suggestion from Will (thanks). In the onTextInserted()
          routine, look to see if the text field is editable or not, and only
          do the chat room message check if the text field is not editable.
          This is a performance improvement as it will no longer do bogus
          chat room checking as the user is typing in text.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Backed out the fix to bug #341371 in onSelectionChanged(). It
          has side-effects on other things. Reopened bug #341371 and bug
          #347691.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Per Wills request, backed out getRowHeader() and getColumnHeader()
          changes in locusOfFocusChanged().

2006-07-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py: fix LABELED_BY/LABELLED_BY typo.  :-(

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py: make sure _getSpeechForObjectRole
        returns a list even if the role of an object is unknown.

        * bugs/bugs.html: reconcile with latest releases of external projects.

        * src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: fix bug 348084 -
        fail gracefully if speech is not available.

2006-07-20  Oana Serb <os@baum.ro>

        * src/orca/util.py: More handling of situations where the
        the label for a FILLER or PANEL is done by placing an
        unbound label as the first child of the FILLER/PANEL and
        the content of the FILLER/PANEL is the second child.

2006-07-20  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py: fix bug 348131 - make SayAll
        perform properly in Evolution.  The main fix is to call
        speech.sayAll once with a custom textLines context generator that
        wraps util.textLines rather than calling it repeatedly with the
        util.textLines generator.

2006-07-19  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/orca.py:
          Moved the Orca specific keybindings out of the init() routine in
          orca.py, over to the setupInputEventHandlers and getKeyBindings()
          routines in default.py.

          _keyBindings in orca.py is currently empty, but the logic is
          retained there, just in case we wish to reinstate those (or
          other) Orca specific key bindings in the future.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
          src/orca/orca.py:
          src/orca/settings.py:
          Reworked how Orca handles "No focus", based on a suggested
          approach from Will (thanks).

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          Reinstating the "and (not already_focused)" test in
          _getSpeechForTableCell(). This is needed to prevent the
          name being repeated when it's the same table that has focus.
          There are still problems will table cells though (see bug #347228).

2006-07-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: more debug output
        when settings.debugEventQueue is enabled.

2006-07-19  Oana Serb <os@baum.ro>

        * src/orca/keynames.py: add new keynames:
          keynames["Meta_L"]      = _("left meta")
          keynames["Meta_R"]      = _("right meta")
          keynames["Num_Lock"]    = _("num lock")
          keynames["Caps_Lock"]   = _("caps lock")
          keynames["Scroll_Lock"] = _("scroll lock")
          keynames["Page_Up"]     = _("page up")
          keynames["Page_Down"]   = _("page down")

        * src/orca/orca.py: delay appending " on" and " off" to key echo
        until after we've looked up the keyname.  Also make " on" and
        " off" internationalized strings.

2006-07-18  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/settings.py:
        add code to allow us to debug the event queue.  It might be
        the source of our hangs.  To enable this, set
        settings.debugEventQueue to True and set your debug level to
        ALL.

2006-07-18  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          Fix for bug #347228. Orca now correctly identifies state of top
          level item in some tree tables.

2006-07-18  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: oops - import 'time' so SayAll
        will work again.

        * src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/settings.py: add experimental "home
        grown" main loop that attempts to side step the GIL some more.  It
        is only enabled if you set settings.useBonoboMain to False (the
        default value is True, which means to use the real bonobo main
        loop).

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: add more logic to allow
        "PROCESS OBJECT EVENT" lines to be output if there is not a
        filter in place.

2006-07-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
        src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: use calls to time.sleep as a means
        to sidestep the global interpreter lock (GIL).  This hopefully
        eliminates a large number of hangs. See the following URLs for
        more information:

2006-07-17  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gaim.py:
          Adjusted the setting of the text field index in onTextInserted()
          that points to the current chat room.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Adjusted use of the event parameter in locusOfFocusChanged(),
          to allow it to work correct if event=None.

          Fix for bug #341371 and bug #347691. Orca will now report the
          file name in file picker when there is only one file existing
          in current folder.

2006-07-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Couple of changes to the speakSetupAssistantLabel() routine:
          - Only speak the screen label if we haven't already done so.
          - If the locus of focus is a push button that's insensitive,
            speak/braille about it. (The Identity screen has such a
            component).

          Adjusted occurances of speech.speak() when used in
          speakSetupAssistantLabel() to supply a second parameter of
          None and a third parameter of False so that they won't interrupt
          previous utterances.

2006-07-14  Oana Serb <os@baum.ro>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
        fallback to the description for buttons if no other text exists.
        This is primarily to handle some situations for the Java platform.

2006-07-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py: further refinement to FILLER label logic:
        don't use the label if it has been specifically set up to
        label something.

2006-07-14  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gaim.py:
          Adjust the "Don't" string to be a complete string in its own
          right ("Do not speak chat room name.") rather than something
          that gets prepended onto another string. Reduces translation
          problems.

          Simplified getting the text field index to just one occurance of:
          index = len(allTextFields-2)

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
          Adjusted the way that noFocus is set in the _dequeueEvent()
          routine. It no longer checks whether the component that has
          focus is not sensitive.

2006-07-13  Oana Serb <os@baum.ro>

        * src/orca/J2SE-access-bridge.py: work on menus and tree nodes.

2006-07-13  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gaim.py:
          Added in gaim script specific support for Insert-h, which
          toggles whether we prefix chat room messages with the name
          of the chat room (default is not to).

        * src/orca/scripts/gaim.py:
          Added in gaim script specific support for Insert-[<n>] where
          <n> is 1-9, which will speak/braille the previous <n>th message.

        * src/orca/scripts/gaim.py:
          Refinements on how we detect we have received a new message in
          the chat room message areas.

2006-07-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
        src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: use locks when mucking around with
        the gidle handling.  We were running into race conditions where we
        were killing the gidle handler when we shouldn't have been doing
        so.  The impact of this was that Orca would sometimes not present
        changes to the display until another event was received.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py: apply similar FILLER logic
        provided Oana Serb at Baum (thanks!) to braille.

2006-07-13  Oana Serb <os@baum.ro>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/util.py: handle case
        where a FILLER object is actually a labeled container that
        groups a set of children.  An example of this is the GEdit
        preferences dialog.

        * src/orca/rolenames.py: make braille string for radio menu item
        consistent with what is being displayed for check menu item.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py: add rolename for radio menu items.

        * src/orca/atspi.py: turn radio buttons and check boxes in
        menu items into their associated menu-like roles (e.g.,
        radio button menu item and check menu item) to better handle
        what we're getting from the Java access bridge.

2006-07-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: move processing of speech
        callbacks for SayAll handling to gidle thread.

2006-07-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Filed Evolution bug #347347, that we need to track, that
          prevents the text selection state ("selected/unselected")
          being properly reported by Orca.

          [a11y] Moving the caret around in the message arrow doesn't
          generate "object:text-caret-moved" events.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
          Slight tweak to only braille/speak "No focus" if the braille/speech
          verbosity level is set to settings.VERBOSITY_LEVEL_VERBOSE.

2006-07-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
          src/orca/settings.py:
          Fix for bug #334892. Reduced the number of times that Orca
          brailles/speaks "No Focus" by moving this logic to the GTK
          idle thread handler and also remembering when "No Focus"
          was last uttered, and not uttering it again if it's within
          a certain time period (settings.noFocusWaitTime - default is
          4 seconds).

2006-07-11  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        *  docs/doc-set/ue_input_style.sgml
        *  docs/doc-set/ue_output_style.sgml
          Updates to both the input and output guides.

2006-07-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: do not print out
        "PROCESS OBJECT EVENT" debug lines if the event debug is
        to be filtered by the debug.eventDebugFilter.

        * orca.spec.in: fix "pyborit" typo.

2006-07-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gaim.py:
          Fix for bug #347163. Adjustment to the gaim script to hopefully
          speak/braille all incoming messages to chat rooms.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #347165. Added in support for numeric keypad 8
          double-clicking, which spells the current line.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/util.py:
          Various tweaks to improve the code for the numeric keypad 5
          double-clicking functionality.

2006-07-10  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/util.py:
          Added in support for numeric keypad 5 double-clicking, which
          spells the current flat review item.

2006-07-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: make sure that the GUI correctly
        reflects the current state of the verbosity level for braille
        and speech (it was saving it correctly, but reading it back in
        incorrectly).

2006-07-10  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #346031. For the purpose of speaking the text
          indentation, replace occurances of '\302\240' (non breaking
          space) with spaces.

2006-07-09  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        *  src/orca/keynames.py
          Corrected the speech output for the right shift key.

2006-07-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/pydoc/Makefile.am: add missing files.

2006-07-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for 0.2.6.

2006-07-09  Willie Walker  <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: handle verbalized punctuation a
        little differently to provide better behavior for both DECtalk and
        festival.  The main thing was to determine when/where to add
        spaces and when to replace a punctuation mark even if the action
        was insert.  In general, spaces are added before the verbalization
        if there is no whitespace before the punctuation mark and added
        after the verbalization if there is no whitespace after the
        puncutation mark.

        In addition, if there is no whitespace after a puncutation mark,
        we replace it even if the action is insert.  The rational for this
        is that we do the insert for special puncutation marks to preserve
        some sense of prosody (e.g., pauses created by periods,
        semi-colons, etc.).  If the punctuation mark is embedded in text,
        it's generally there for semantic purposes other than prosody, so
        we just replace it with its verbalized form (if the verbalized
        puncutation level is appropriate, of course).

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: fix for bug 347054 - allow
        readTableCellRow and speechVerbosityLevel to be set.

2006-07-09  Alexander Shopov  <ash@contact.bg>

        * configure.in: Added "bg" (Bulgarian) to ALL_LINGUAS

2006-07-03  Runa Bhattacharjee <runabh@gmail.com>

        * configure.in: Added Bengali India (bn_IN) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2006-07-02  Willie Walker  <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: set "punctuation mode" parameter
        to none (0.0) for any speaker that has been created.  This allows
        Orca to handle the speaking of punctuation rather than rely upon
        the relatively inconsistent way it is spoken across various engines.

2006-07-02  Ilkka Tuohela  <hile@iki.fi>

        * configure.in: Added 'fi' to ALL_LINGUAS.

2006-06-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py:
          Added bullet-proofing to getZonesFromAccessible() to just return
          an empty list if accessible.component is None.

2006-06-29  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@indlinux.org>

        * configure.in: Added 'dz' (Dzongkha) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2006-06-29  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          Refinement to the fix for bug #343897. I now use the timestamp
          from the last AT-SPI device event as the parameter to
          set_user_time().

2006-06-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          Fix for bug #343897. Sets the current time on the Configuration
          GUI window so that it'll get focus. set_user_time is a new call
          in pygtk 2.9.2 or later. It's surronded by a try/except block
          here so that if it's not found, then we can fail gracefully.

          Couple of refinements suggested by Gustavo. See bug #343897
          for more details.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Fix for bug #341388. Small change in the processObjectEvent()
          routine. If we receive a "window:deactivate" event for the
          object that currently has focus, then stop the current speech
          output. This is very useful for terminating long speech output
          from commands running in gnome-terminal.

2006-06-27  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        *  src/orca/speechgenerator.py
          Slight change to brief verbosity to speak buttons and combo boxes.

2006-06-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Added in support for speech indentation in the mail message
          areas. See also bug #346031, for a current limitation.

        * src/orca/scripts/gnome-terminal.py:
          Adjusted the onTextInserted() method to just return if
          orca.lastInputEvent was None or if this wasn't a keyboard
          event.

2006-06-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/flat_review.py: more fixing for
        bug 343133 where Orca would hang when going into flat review of a
        man page in gnome-terminal.  The problem is that the AT-SPI
        implementation of text in gnome-terminal appears to produce
        inaccurate and wild results.  We need to handle this defensively.


2006-06-27  Runa Bhattacharjee <runa@bengalinux.org>

        * configure.in: Added Bengali (bn) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2006-06-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py:
          Slight change to the __addVerbalizedPunctuation() routine:
          If we are moving around by single characters, then always speak
          the punctuation. We try to detect this by looking for just a
          single character being spoken.

          Another slight change to the __addVerbalizedPunctuation( ) routine:
          For each of the characters in the text to be spoken, if it's
          not a punctuation character, we still want to see if that
          character is in the chnames dictionary, and if so, speak that
          entry instead.

          Another slight change to the __addVerbalizedPunctuation( ) routine:
          Special case for periods in text like filenames or URL's:
          If this is a period and there is a non-space character on either
          side of it, then always speak it.

          Added a " " after each verbalized punctuation word to prevent
          word concatenation.

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in an entry for a new Evolution bug #345923:
          "[A11y] Unable to keyboard navigate to month view "day"
          entries, when no initial events."

          Added in an entry for a new Evolution bug #345969:
          "[A11y] Evolution crashes when trying to creat a calendar event
          when Orca screen reader is running."

2006-06-22  Rhys Jones  <rhys@sucs.org>

        * configure.in: Added "cy" (Welsh) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2006-06-22  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          Default setting for verbalized punctuation is now
          settings.PUNCTUATION_STYLE_MOST.

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py:
          In __addVerbalizedPunctuation(), if the user has style
          settings.PUNCTUATION_STYLE_NONE, just return the old text.

          In __addVerbalizedPunctuation(), add a space after the spoken
          equivalent of the punctuation, so that DECtalk doesn't speak
          it twice.

2006-06-22  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am:
          src/orca/chnames.py:
          src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py:
          src/orca/punctuation_settings.py:
          src/orca/settings.py:
          Added in verbalized punctuation support. See comments at the
          beginning of punctuation_settings.py for more details.

          NOTE: This is only currently implemented in gnomespeechfactory.py

2006-06-22  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          src/orca/orca_prefs.py
          src/orca/settings.py:
          Added in a new radio button "Most" to the punctuation verbosity
          group on the speech pane in the configuration GUI. Adjusted the
          callback and initialisation routines to handle this properly.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          The checks against various widget labels on the configuration GUI
          was not taking into consideration the underline characters used
          as accelerators.

2006-06-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/J2SE-access-bridge.py: check in
        initial Java toolkit script from Lynn Monsanto.  He's still
        waiting for a GNOME account, but I want to get this stuff in prior
        to going to GUADEC.

2006-06-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          src/orca/settings.py:
          Added in a new radio button group to the configuration GUI on
          the speech pane, that can be used to set "Table Row Speech" to
          either: "Speak current cell" or "Speak current row".

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in another StarOffice Writer bug:
          137437: [A11y] Incorrect char in any_data.value() field of
          event when text is deleted.

2006-06-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Adjustment to the onSelectionChanged() routine to get "has
          formula" working again.

2006-06-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Further adjustment of the handling of speaking a row of a Calc
          spread sheet. Only speak the row if the user has moved focus up
          or down a row, not when the focus has just moved left or right in
          the same row (unless this is on the first or last row of the table).

2006-06-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py:
          src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/settings.py:
          src/orca/speechgenerator.py
          src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Changed all occurances of readTreeTableCellRow to
          readTableCellRow, as we now handle both tables and
          tree tables.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Adjusted the handling of speaking a row of a Calc spread sheet.
          It will only braille/speak each cell if that cell is showing.

2006-06-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py:
          src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          Adjusted the _getBrailleRegionsForTableCell and
          _getSpeechForTableCell() routines so that Insert-F11 works
          with table cells inside both tables and tree tables.

          Don't set the last table row and column in these routines
          This is now done in locusOfFocusChanged (see entry for
          default.py below).

        * src/orca/default.py:
          In locusOfFocusChanged(), if this focus change is for a table
          cell, save the table row and column in the table (as lastRow and
          lastColumn), so that they can be used by the speech and braille
          table cell generators.

          In locusOfFocusChanged(), replaced calls to getRowDescription()
          and getColumnDescription() with calls to getRowHeader() and
          getColumnHeader() and then called getDisplayedText on their
          accessible objects.

2006-06-20  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added in the following two StarOffice bugs:
          #137415 [A11y] Control-Shift-Left/Right can select whitespace
          #137416 [A11y] No way to get at indentation information in Writer.

2006-06-20  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gnome-terminal.py: fix bug 345472 - don't
        assume the last input event was a KeyboardEvent.

        * src/orca/scripts/gcalctool.py: fix bug caused by my refactor
        of moving things to util.py (forgot to import orca.util).

2006-06-20  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Changes to the sayPhrase() routine to better handle StarOffice
          Writer cases where there is a start or end offset of -1.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Further change to the StarOffice text indentation handling.
          Removed the percentage routine and just called the "default"
          speakTextIndentation() routine. This seems to work okay for
          lines indented by tabs and spaces.

          NOTE: Lines indented via the "Increase line indentation" in
                the StarOffice Writer toolbar are not handled. There
                doesn't seem to be a way to get at this information.

2006-06-20  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Change to the speakTextIndentation() routine:
          StarOffice Writer documents typically have a margin around the
          actual text. This margin width is removed (both the left and right
          margins), before the percentage calculation is performed.

2006-06-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: handle issue where toolkit name and version
        might be unknown when printing out script information using
        Insert+F3.

2006-06-19  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py:
          src/orca/default.py:
          Moved the speakTextIndentation() routines into default.py so
          that it can be subclassed.

          On Mike's advice, removed the word "indented" from the text
          spoken for text indentation (too verbose).

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Subclassed the speakTextIndentation() routine and adjusted it to
          speak an indication of the percentage of whitespace (spaces and
          tabs at the beginning of the line.

          NOTE: This percentage value seems to be incorrect when there are
                no spaces or tabs at the beginning of the line. Still
                investigating this.

2006-06-19  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py:
          Added in a speakTextIndentation() routine that will speak a
          summary of the number of spaces and/or tabs at the beginning
          of the given line.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Added a chunk of code to the start of the sayPhrase() routine,
          to swap the startOffset and endOffset values if they are in the
          wrong order. StarOffice can't cope with them otherwise.

          Adjusted the sayLine() routine to call util.speakTextIndentation()
          if we have speech indentation enabled.

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Added in a checkbox to the Speech page of the Configuration GUI,
          for speech indentation and justification (default is unchecked).

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          Added a speechIndentationChecked() signal handler for speaking
          indentation.

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          Added in support for the new 'enableSpeechIndentation" setting.

2006-06-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py: check for windows that end with
        the name "Assistant" when handling the setup wizards.  The reason
        for this is that both the initial setup and the new account
        wizards need this special scripting, and we're lucky that they end
        in the name Assistant.  A risk here is that the l10n of the window
        names might put Assistant somewhere else in the title (e.g.,
        Assistante de Setup).  If we run into this, we should do a check
        on the exact names.

2006-06-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Adjusted section #3 in the locusOfFocusChanged() method.
          Unfortunately the default read table cell row handling won't
          just work with Evolution (see bogusity comment later in the
          script). We quickly solve this by setting readTreeTableCellRow
          to False for the duration of this code section, then resetting
          it to True at the end.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Changed to provide useful feedback for the StarOffice Setup
          wizard screens. See the comments in the StarOffice script
          for more details.

2006-06-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/script.py:
        more work on bug 319652.  Move much of the processing of
        input events to the gidle thread handler in an effort to
        reduce hangs.

2006-06-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Changed to provide useful feedback for the Evolution Setup
          Assistant screens. See the comments in the Evolution script
          for more details.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Fixup for the "has formula" check for spread sheet cells.
          This should only be spoken if the input line starts with "="
          (thanks Will!)

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py:
          src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          Adjusted the speaking and brailling of table cells to not
          speak the whole row again, if the user just moved left or
          right (rather than up or down).

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py:
          src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          src/orca/settings.py:
          src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Changed all occurances of readTableCellRow to readTreeTableCellRow.
          Changed the default values of readTreeTableCellRow to True.
          Adjusted the speaking and brailling of table cells to only
          potentially speak the whole role if the parent is a tree table
          rather than just a table.

2006-06-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py,
        src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/httpserver.py: make the HTTP server a
        separate module.  This reduces complexity in the speech module and
        also gives us room to extend the command set that Orca can handle.

        NOTE: this represents a change in settings - speechServerPort is
        now defunct and has been replace by httpServerPort.

2006-06-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: fix bug 344880 - process command line
        arguments even if a11y is not enabled.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
          Adjust so that we use settings.readTableCellRow now, rather than
          Script.readTableCellRow.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Better handle the situation where the user types Control-Shift-Left
          or Control-Shift-Right and the text cursor position was in the
          middle of a word.

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          Support for speech for generic readTableCellRow (Insert+F11).

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py
          Support for speech for generic readTableCellRow (Insert+F11).

2006-06-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: add Thunderbird broken table bug 340978.

        * src/orca/settings.py, src/orca/atspi.py: provide a setting
        (settings.cacheAccessibles) to determine whether to cache
        accessibles locally or not.

        * src/orca/scripts/metacity.py: fix exception that was being
        silently swallowed by focus_tracking_presenter.py.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: do not silently swallow
        exceptions when processing object events.  Needed to catch this
        in a couple spots.

2006-06-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py:
          Slight adjustment to the speakTextSelectionState() routine
          to save away the last text cursor position. This will be used
          in the _presentTextAtNewCaretPosition() routine in default.py.

          Further adjustments to the speakTextSelectionState() routine
          to handle special cases:

            Shift-Page-Down:    speak "page selected from cursor position".
            Shift-Page-Up:      speak "page selected to cursor position".
            Control-Shift-Down: speak "line selected down from cursor position".
            Control-Shift-Up:   speak "line selected up from cursor position".
            Control-Shift-Home: speak "document selected to cursor position".
            Control-Shift-End:  speak "document selected from cursor position".

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Now handles the following cases:
            Shift-Up:
            Shift-Down:
            Shift-Home:
            Shift-End:
            Control-Shift-Page-Down:
            Control-Shift-Page-Up:
          We speak the text that's been selected (followed by "selected").
          If there was text selected it speaks that previously selected
          text, followed by "unselected".

          Added in a section to handle Control-A (entire document selected).

2006-06-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/settings.py: fix bug
        344307 - add new setting, enableBrailleGrouping, to determine
        whether items such as menu items and page tabs should be grouped
        with their siblings on the braille display.  Disable this by
        default to provide better runtime performance.  NOTE: this
        represents a change in the UI for Orca - the behavior to date has
        been to always group menu items.  The user responsiveness was bad
        for large menus, however, so we decided to make this an optional
        feature.

        * bugs/bugs.html: update to include various bugs we need to track

2006-06-07  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py: fix for bug 344218 - handle the case where
        the gnome-terminal terminal's role changes from unknown to
        terminal.  We do this by not caching roles that are ROLE_UNKNOWN.
        The main problem here appears to be that the terminal issues
        events prior to its role being set up properly, and the atk
        (atkobject.c:927) has specific code to prevent notification for
        when the role changes from ROLE_UNKNOWN to seomthing else.

2006-06-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py:
          Adjustments to the speakTextSelectionState() routine to handle
          [un]selecting by word (Control-Shift-[Left, Right]).

          Still need to handle [Control]-Shift-[Up, Down, Home, End,
          Page-Up, Page-Down].

          This is how we are proposing to handle these twelve cases:

          Shift-Up:
          Shift-Down:
          Shift-Home:
          Shift-End:
          Control-Shift-Page-Down:
          Control-Shift-Page-Up:
          Speak the text that's been selected (followed by "selected").
          If there was text selected it should speak that previously
          selected text, followed by "unselected".

          Shift-Page-Down:
          Control-Shift-Down:
          Speak the last selected line then say "page selected from
          cursor position".

          Shift-Page-Up:
          Control-Shift-Up:
          Speak the first selected line then say "page selected to
          cursor position".

          Control-Shift-Home:
          Speak the first selected line then say "document selected to
          cursor position".

          Control-Shift-End:
          Speak the last selected line then say "document selected from
          cursor position".

2006-06-06  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py:
          Added a new speakTextSelectionState() that will speak "selected"
          if the text was just selected, "unselected" if it was just
          unselected.

          Slight adjustments to the isTextSelected() routine to pass in a
          start and end offset for the text.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Adjustments to the sayCharacter(), sayWord() and sayLine() routines
          to call speakTextSelectionState()

2006-06-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/speechserver.py,
        src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: add support for isSpeaking and
        allow this to also be something that can be queried via the HTTP
        support.

2006-06-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py:
          Added a new isTextSelected() routine that returns True if the
          text caret associated with the given Accessible object, is
          located within a selected region of text.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Updates to the sayCharacter(), sayWord() and sayLine() routines
          to speak "selected", if the user navigated around holding the
          Shift key down.

2006-06-03  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/brl/brlmodule.c: fix for bug 343666: use PyGILState calls to
        call into Python to prevent thread deadlock.

2006-06-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/espeechfactory.py:
          src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py:

          src/orca/settings.py:
          src/orca/speech.py:
          src/orca/speechserver.py:
          Added in keyboard bindings for:
          Insert-Up     (Increase speech pitch).
          Insert-Down   (Decrease speech pitch).

2006-06-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * docs/pydoc/.cvsignore
          Added in all the generated HTML files.

        * src/orca/scripts/gedit.py:
          Reinserted missing "#" character at the beginning of line 1
          that was causing a SyntaxError: invalid syntax when running gedit.

        * src/orca/orca.py:
          Various changes to keyboard bindings:
          F12 or SunF37 ==> Insert-q         (Quits Orca).
          Control-Insert-F5 ==> Insert-F4    (Cycles debug level).
          Control-Insert-F7 ==> Insert-F8    (Prints debug information about
                                              the application with focus).
          Insert-F8 ==> Insert-F10           (Switches to the next
                                              presentation manager.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Insert-i ==> Insert-F3   (Reports information on current script).

          Speak either "Speak row" or "Speak cell" in
          toggleTableCellReadMode() depending upon the new setting of
          self.readTableCellRow.

        src/orca/scripts/gedit.py, src/orca/scripts/metacity.py,
        src/orca/scripts/planner.py: refactor to pull spurious utilities
        out of orca.py and atspi.py and put them in util.py.

        * src/orca/util.py: when looking into hierarchies for objects, do
        not pursue hiearchies under objects that are not showing.

2006-05-31  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
          Readjusted _getSpeechForFrame() to just get the default speech
          instead of treating the frame like an alert and speaking all
          unrelated labels. We'll need to see if this has any adverse
          effects and adjust accordingly.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Even better handling of the "has formula" situation for spread sheet
          table cells. This is now done in the onSelectionChanged() method
          when the Name Box combo box gets an "object:selection-changed"
          event.

2006-05-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: possible fix for bug
        342022.  It appears as though the desktop would get a little flaky
        as synaptic was popping up windows and then destroying them as it
        was showing progress.  This provides yet another defensive
        mechanism to handle this.  Note that synaptic in general needs a
        bit of scripting to make it truly usable.

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: fix for bug 343133 where Orca would
        reliably hang when attempting to do a flat review of gnome-terminal
        when the user was viewing a man page.  This seems to be caused by
        a bug in gnome-terminal returning nonsensical offsets from
        getTextAtOffset.  We needed to do a little defensive programming
        here.

2006-05-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Better handling of the "has formula" situation for spread sheet
          table cells. Because the updating of the input line might not
          have happened when the table cell gets focus, this is now done
          in the onTextInserted method.

2006-05-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Added in a speakInputLine handler (triggered by typing Insert-a),
          that will speak the contents of the spread sheet input line,
          assuming the current locus of focus is a table cell.

          Created a global isSpreadSheetCell() routine, that is used (in
          three places) to determine if the given object is a table cell.

2006-05-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py:
          Fix for bug #343013.
          http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343013
          The command line option strings should not be translatable.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Adjusted the braille/speech out for StarOffice spread sheet
          table cells to append "has formula" if the input line contents
          for the spread sheet did not match what is being displayed in
          the table cell.

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added Evolution bug #343035 to the list of bugs to track.

2006-05-25  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Added in BrailleGenerator:_getBrailleRegionsForTableCell and
          SpeechGenerator:_getSpeechForTableCell in order to better
          braille/speak the contents of a spread sheet table cell.

2006-05-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py: call gobject.threads_init() in an attempt to
        help further address bug 319652.

2006-05-24  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added in a specific sayAll() method for Evolution. We have to
          do this because Evolution does now implement the FLOWS_TO
          relationship and all the text are in an HTML panel which
          contains multiple panels, each containing a single text object.

          Needed to subclass the setupInputEventHandlers() method so that
          we could add in an input event handler that pointed at our sayAll()
          method.

2006-05-23  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py: pass "orbit-io-thread" to initialize the ORB
        in threaded mode.  This should hopefully help address bug 319652:

        http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=319652

        * src/orca/speech.py: add GET support to HTTP server as a means
        to check Orca version number.

2006-05-23  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

      * src/orca/scripts/gedit.py:
        - Changed all occurances of onFocus() to locusOfFocusChanged().
        - Adjustment so that a single line change will "fire off" all
          the debug messages in the gedit script.
        - Removed the call to orca.setLocusOfFocus() in readMisspeltWord().

      * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py:
        - Changed all occurances of onFocus() to locusOfFocusChanged().
        - Removed various calls to orca.setLocusOfFocus()

      * src/orca/util.py:
        Adjusted the textLines() routine to look for FLOWS_TO relationships
        and follow them to get further potential text objects to speak.

2006-05-22  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

      * src/orca/gnome/speechfactory.py:
        Adjusted the speakUtterances() method to not speak zero length
        lines of text. This has hopefully improved some speech interruption
        problems.

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in new Star Office bug #136221.

2006-05-21
      *  /docs/doc-set/testing.sgml: added more tests
2006-05-20  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speech.py: do not attempt to restart the http speech
        server when settings are reloaded.  I'm not quite sure how to
        kill the server once it starts, but we may need to figure this
        out at some point if we want to dynamically change the speech
        server port at run time.  For now, if that is what people really
        want to do, they can just stop and restart orca.

        * src/orca/default.py: minor tweaking to script info output.

2006-05-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 342303 - stop
        speech when the user presses the mouse button.  This also moved the
        handling of the lastInputEvent for the mouse from default.py to
        orca.py, which is in line with where it is being set for keyboard
        and braille events.

2006-05-19  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * .cvsignore:
          docs/.cvsignore:
          docs/pydoc/.cvsignore:
          Added several more files that should be ignored.

        * src/orca/atspi.py:
          In the getAcceleratorAndShortcut() method, if the accelerator
          string includes a Space, make sure we speak it.

          In the __init__ method, self.toolkitName and self.version are
          now correctly initialized.

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Added a new reportScriptInfo() method that is called when the
          user types Insert-i. It provides useful information on the
          script for the application that currently has focus; output
          being in speech, braille and debug println formats.

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Changed occurances of onFocus to locusOfFocusChanged and now
          no longer call orca.setLocusOfFocus().

        * bugs/bugs.html:
          Added in new Star Office bug #136117.

2006-05-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py: fix for bug 342122 - use all labels when
        presenting an object.

        * src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py: fix for bug 342132 - make YELP
        speak the text for an object when a link is selected.

2006-05-18  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py
          Adjusted the _getBrailleRegionsForPushButton() method to no
          longer call self._getDefaultBrailleRegions(obj), but instead to
          do everything that's in that rourine except:

            text = util.appendString(text, self._getTextForValue(obj))

          This gets rid of the spurious "0.00" value from Star Office
          buttons, that was showing up in the braille display.

2006-05-18  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am,
        src/orca/scripts/gnome-window-properties.py: fix for bug 342133 -
        do not automatically read labels in the dialog window when it
        appears.  Also need to refile this bug against
        gnome-window-properties so they do the appropriate bindings for
        labels.

        * src/orca/scripts/metacity.py: fix bug 341415 - eliminate
        redundant output of Workspace and also make sure new Workspaces
        are announced.

        * src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am, src/orca/scripts/self_voicing.py:
        add a script that does nothing.  One can map an application to
        this script (self_voicing) via orca.settings.setScriptMapping,
        and it can be used to tell Orca to be quiet for self-voicing
        applications.

2006-05-18  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added in four StarOffice bugs (plus SO bug filing information).
          Updated the status of the OpenOffice bugs.

2006-05-17  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Adjusted the call to speech.speak() in scenerio #1 in the
          onFocus() method so that it doesn't interrupt speech. This
          means that when Star Office Writer is first coming up, it
          speaks the details about the document that it is displaying.

2006-05-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: remove text.replace("[", "[ ")
        now that gnome-speech-0.4.0 tells DECtalk to do a [:phon off].

        * bugs/bugs.html, bugs/bug_338233.py, bugs/bug_338234.py,
        bugs/bug_338272.py: add Firefox bugs.

        * src/orca/speech.py: change speech server support to an HTTP
        server looking for POST data of "speak:text" or "stop" commands.

2006-05-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/settings.py: first pass at allowing
        Orca to act as a speech server for self-voicing applications.
        Orca will listen on the port defined by settings.speechServerPort
        and will respond to simple single line "speak:text" and "stop"
        commands.  The motivation for this is to allow FestVox to use Orca
        as its speech service, and to have the user's default voice for
        Orca to be used for speaking.

2006-05-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Adjustment so that a single line change will "fire off" all
          the debug messages in the StarOffice script.

          Adjusted the readMisspeltWord() routine to no longer call
          orca.setLocusOfFocus. This now means that when you Tab around
          the various components on the Spell Checking dialogs, they are
          properly spoken.

        * README, NEWS: Prep for 0.2.4 release.
        * configure.in, orca.spec.in: more dependency tweaking

2006-05-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gnome-terminal.py: add an onTextDeleted
        method to handle the bizarro behavior we get when we backspace
        in a terminal and there is still text to the right.

        NOTE TO ALL: terminal is screwy.  When you press "BackSpace", it
        pads out the rest of the line to the right with spaces.  Then,
        whenever you press space, it will no longer issue text inserted
        events for the space if you are typing at what looks like the end
        of the line.  Instead, it only issues caret moved events.  To top
        that off, if you've done a backspace and have then arrowed in a
        little bit from the end of what looks like the end of the line,
        you get a text inserted event for the remainder of the line.  We
        end up speaking this.  So, hey, type perfectly in terminal, never
        hit backspace, and things will work fine. :-P

2006-05-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: fix bug where modifier bit positions
        were being used as bits (i.e., didn't do a '1 <<' prior to
        using the bit position).

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/input_event.py: refactor the way
        event_string's containing control characters are converted.
        This moves the logic to input_event.py:KeyboardEvent.

        * src/orca/scripts/gnome-terminal.py: try to better handle
        what to do in the case of command line completion ("Tab")
        as well as Delete and ctrl+d.

        NOTE TO ALL: it looks as though there's a bug somewhere in the way
        gtk/gail/atk handles text deletion events.  Instead of the event
        containing the text that's been deleted, it contains the text at
        the current caret position.  This will be apparent when you
        BackSpace in a GTK text widget - if the caret is at the end of the
        text, you will hear nothing; if the caret is in the middle of the
        text, you will hear the character at the caret.  Note that GEdit
        and the mail composer widget (but not the to/cc/subject lines) of
        Evolution seem to get it right.

2006-05-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Adjusted to the onTextInserted() routine to check to see if
          the event.role is rolenames.ROLE_PASSWORD_TEXT (i.e. a
          password field), in which case the text is spoken (which will
          be the stars used to hide the users real password input).

2006-05-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py
          Added a check at the top of the _keyEcho() method to see if
          this is a keyboard event for a component with a role name of
          rolenames.ROLE_PASSWORD_TEXT (such as a password field).
          If it is, then the key is not echoed.

2006-05-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py:
          Adjustments to the onTextDeleted method:
          - to speak the deleted character when the user presses Backspace
            as opposed to the previous remaining character.
          - if it's not a Backspace or Delete character, then just return.
          - now do voice check on text.caretOffset.

2006-05-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py:
          Added some bullet-proofing to the __init__ method to check
          that self.source is not None.

2006-05-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjustment so that a single line change will "fire off" all
          the debug messages in the Evolution script.

2006-05-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gnome-terminal.py: add onTextInserted to
        handle terminal-ish behavior.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/orca_prefs.py,
        src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py: do not let user run Orca if a11y
        has been enabled.  Instead, dump them into the text setup and then
        tell them to log out and log back in.

        * configure.in, acinclude.m4: add configure-time dependency
        checking for needed libraries and python modules.

        * orca.spec.in: yet another try to get these right.

        * src/orca/orca.py: if learn mode is enabled, let it do key
        echo.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: create the fallback
        default script on initialization.  This will register the
        appropriate events so we can detect metacity activity in
        the case where orca starts up and no accessible apps have
        any active windows.  Hopefully a fix for bug 341415.

2006-05-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: figure out how to use debug.println
        to output debug info.

        * src/orca/default.py: work on preventing echo "bleed through"
        when typing quickly and echo is not turned on.  The main problem
        causing this was the toolkit apparently doing compression of
        multiple keystrokes, causing us to get a longer string in a
        single text inserted event instead of individual inserted events
        for each keystroke.  I'm wondering if there might be a better
        way to skin this cat, such as handling input events immediately
        for controlling orca, but then adding them to the queue for
        post-processing of stuff like key echo.  I'm not sure...

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: remove errant speech.stop
        that gets called when a window is activated.  The resulting calls
        to speech.speak from the associated script for the window should
        do the appropriate stop as needed.  This helps with not interrupting
        a key echo in progress when a new window appears.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/speech.py: do not interrupt a key
        echo in progress.

2006-05-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py
          In _keyEcho(), moved the control key logic to the top, so that
          it works correctly with sequences such as "Control-O' in gedit.

2006-05-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py
          In _isPrintableKey(), had to explicitly look for an event_string
          of "space" and return True if found.

2006-05-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py, src/orca/default.py: work on word echo.
        It should be working much better now (I HOPE!).

2006-05-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          Removed the LABELLED_BY relationships for the radio buttons
          on the speech and braille panes. These are no longer needed
          as these radio button groups are inside GtkFrame widgets which
          have that label as their title.

2006-05-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py
          Removed "space", "Left", "Right", "Up" and "Down" from the
          list of action keys.

2006-05-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Adjusted the onTextDeleted() method so that the previous/next
          character is always spoken when the user presses Backspace/Delete,
          irrespective of whether user has "enableKeyEcho" set.

2006-05-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Added in a dialog that will be used via GUI configuration,
          to ask the question on whether the user wants to logout now.
          See bug 340849 for more details.

2006-05-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/metacity.py: don't call workspaces
        "inaccessible" when using Ctrl+Alt+arrow to move between
        workspaces.

2006-05-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/orca.py,
        src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/settings.py:
        refactor the way we communicate with Orca.  The Java platform's
        CORBA implementation seems to do two things we don't like:
        1) Give us CORBA::Object's instead of Bonobo::Unknown's or better.
        We solve this by making sure we _narrow all objects to types that
        we expect.  This is a rather pervasive change.
        2) Glitch out often in communication, causing COMM_FAILURE's.
        We solve this problem by retrying the same thing a few times
        before we give up.  More often than not, the COMM_FAILURE was
        a temporary glitch and communication is re-established by the
        2nd or 3rd try.

2006-05-10  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Adjusted the sayLine() routine to ignore zero length lines.
          This has the side-effect of not interrupting speaking of
          the "Page Down" key when the last line in the document is
          empty.

2006-05-10  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py
          Added code to _keyEcho() to try to detect the state (on or off)
          of the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys and to speak their state.
          This seems to be working fine for Caps Lock, but Num Lock is
          always returning a state of "on".

2006-05-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py: fix bug where a None app name would
        cause problems with getScriptModuleName.

        * src/orca/scripts/planner.py: apply patch to fix bug 338097.
        Supplied by community member Javier (thanks!)

2006-05-09  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py
          Added "Home" and "End" to the list of action keys recognized by
          Orca in the _isActionKey() method.

2006-05-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: a little more work with the keyecho stuff.
        Don't interrupt speech when speaking information regarding the
        backspace and delete keys - something else related to them is
        typically already going on; if we interrupt it, we might not be
        hearing everything we want to hear.

2006-05-09  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Slight adjustment to the onTextDeleted() method. The offset
          value (for both the "Delete" and "Backspace" cases) was off by one.

2006-05-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: work for bug 338890.  Introduces use
        of getopt to parse options, introduces a "usage" option,
        and adds command line options to get help and version
        information.

2006-05-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/mag.py: set crosshair color with cursor color.

2006-05-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Added in an else: clause to handle calls to onTextDeleted()
          which weren't triggered by typing Delete or Backspace, so that
          the offset variable can be correctly set.

2006-05-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Changes to the onTextDeleted() method to make Delete and
          Backspace do the correct thing in gedit w.r.t. the new
          key echo requirements.

          Note that Terminal and Star Office Writer still need to
          be fixed up. This might have to be done by over-ridding
          the onTextDeleted() methods in the scripts for those
          applications.

2006-05-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
        Adjusted several duplicate mnemonics to try to generate
        uniqueless. There is only one control (the "Color:" label for
        the color button on the magnifier pane) which does not have a
        mnemonic, because there are no unique letters available.

2006-05-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
        Adjusted the magnifier pane to use GtkFrames to enclose four
        areas: Cursor Settings, Cross-hair Settings, Zoomer Settings
        and Zoomer Position.

2006-05-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py,
        src/orca/espeechfactory.py, src/orca/speechserver.py,
        src/orca/speech.py: fix for bug 340773.  When autoreading the
        labels in a newly appeared dialog box, do not let an immediate
        focus event interrupt the labels being spoken.

2006-05-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: enable accessibility if it has not
        been enabled and issue a message.  Partially addresses
        bug 340849, but I need some help from Rich on this.  :-)

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: provide fallbacks in
        the event of starting up with no speech parameters set
        (e.g., first time run).

        * src/orca/mag.py: add try/except around import of gtk
        so orca can be setup without requiring the DISPLAY to
        be set.

        * src/orca/orca.py: automatically run setup if user
        settings are not available.  Also allow automatic setup
        to be overridden via the "--no-setup" option to allow
        for things such as accessible login to work.

        * src/orca/orca.py: reduce debug level of import error
        message that's issued if user-settings cannot be found.
        It's OK for this file to not exist - Orca is designed
        to run without it, but the message was confusing users.

2006-05-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          Incorporate GUI rework from Calum Benson, which makes it
          more HIG compliant.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          Adjustments to match the new Glade file layout.
          Changed the print specification in magCursorColorSet() to
          print leading zeroes instead of spaces.

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          src/orca/orca_prefs.py:
          src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py:
          src/orca/orca-setup.glade:
          Added in two new mouse tracking modes: None and Proportional.

2006-05-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py: fix setting of tracking mode

        * src/orca/mag.py: support the color preferences string better

        * src/orca/mag.py: add proportional mouse tracking mode.

        * src/orca/mag.py: add push mouse tracking mode.

        * src/orca/mag.py: add smoothing type.

        * src/orca/mag.py, src/orca/default.py: add zoomer placement
        support to magnification and also repaint dirty regions when
        we get a visual appearance changed notification.

2006-05-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py:
          Adjusted the bogus "screenWidth = 480" to "screenHeight = 480"
          in the except: clause of the import for gtk.gdk. This now
          allows "orca --text-setup" to work from the console (again).

2006-05-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/mag.py, src/orca/default.py: work on hooking up the
        settings to the magnifier.  Still need to support:
           - enableMagCursor
           - magZoomer{Left,Right,Top,Bottom} (only uses default)
           - magSmoothingMode (only uses default)
           - magMouseTrackingMode (only supports center)

        * docs/doc-set/orca.sgml, docs/doc-set/ue_requirements.sgml,
        docs/doc-set/orca.html, docs/doc-set/orca.pdf: Add links from
        requirements to tests.

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Changed "Speech server:" to "Speech synthesizer:"
          Changed "Family:" to "Person:"

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Implemented:
            magCursorColorSet(self, widget):

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Re-enabled grouping of the two sets of radio buttons on the
          speech notebook pane.

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Implemented:
            magSmoothingChanged(self, widget):
            magMouseTrackingChanged(self, widget):

          Fixed up the the reading of the "enableSpeech" and
          "enableMagnifier" preferences in _initGUIState().

          Fixed up the setting of the initial values for the smoothing
          mode and mouse tracking mode combo boxes in _initGUIState().

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Adjusted the magCursorExplicitSizeChecked() method so that
          it [un]sensitizes the cursor size spin button and label
          depending upon whether the explicit cursor size checkbox
          is checked.

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py
          Fix for bug 340662 (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=340662)
          Added a try/except clause arround the "import gtk.gdk", so that
          if it fails, we are still able to set screenWidth and screenHeight
          to something sensible.

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/mag.py
          src/orca/settings.py
          src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Changed occurances of "magScaleFactor" to "magZoomFactor"

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Implemented:
            magCursorOnOffChecked(self, widget):
            magCursorExplicitSizeChecked(self, widget):
            magCursorSizeValueChanged(self, widget):

            magInvertColorsChecked(self, widget):

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/mag.py
          src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          src/orca/settings.py
          Changed magXScaleFactor and magYScaleFactor to a single
          magScaleFactor. This means that you currently can't magnify
          different amounts for X and Y.  If this functionality is
          needed, we can implement it in a future release.

        * src/orca/orca_prefs.py
          Added _getMagCursorColorString(), _getMagSmoothingModeString()
          and _getMagMouseTrackingModeString() that return strings
          representing the magnification cursor color, the magnification
          smoothing mode and the magnification mouse tracking mode
          respectively, and adjusted the writePreferences() method to
          use them.

        * src/orca/settings.py
          Changed magCursorColor from 0xFFFFFF to '#000000' (white to black
          and in the correct format for gtk.gdk.color_parse().

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Added in an "Enable Speech" checkbox at the top of the speech
          notebook pane.
          Added in an "Enable Magnification" checkbox at the top of the
          magnification notebook pane.
          Refactor of the speech and magnifier panes to make it easier
          to [un]sensitize the various components depending upon whether
          the user has speech and/or magnification enabled.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Added in a speechSupportChecked signal handler for the "Enable
          Speech" checkbox. The sensitivity of all the rest of the items
          on the speech pane is dependent upon this setting.

          Added in a magnificationSupportChecked signal handler for the
          "Enable Magnification" checkbox. The sensitivity of all the rest
          of the items on the magnification pane is dependent upon this
          setting.

          [Un]sensitize speech and magnification components depending
          upon whether speech and/or magnification is enabled.

          Setup the initial state of the magnifier pane from the users
          magnification settings.

        * src/orca/setting.py
          Changed "magSmoothingModee" to "magSmoothingMode".
          Added in a setting for "magCursorColor".

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/mag.py src/orca/settings.py
          Changed settings magX and magY to magXScaleFactor and
          magYScaleFactor to clarify meaning and avoid name confusion
          with zoomer placement.

        * src/orca/settings.py
          Added in settings (plus default values) for all the items
          that can be configured via the Magnification notebook pane
          in the Preferences GUI.

2006-05-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * configure.in, orca.spec.in: another pass at the dependencies.

        * src/orca/util.py, src/orca/default.py,
        src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py: more
        fixing for bug 340635.  Move the notion of handling the "real"
        active descendant to the speech and braille generators.  This
        allows us to better handle expanded and collapsed states of cells.

        * src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 340635.  Cache the active
        descendant of an object.  Also keep track of the "real" active
        descendant and use this in the case where a parent that manages
        its descendants gets focus (i.e., the real locus of focus is the
        active descendant and not the parent).

2006-05-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Removed the Focus tracking mode setting. Moved the "Invert
          Colors" checkbox up near the Zoom factor setting, and created
          a "Zoomer settings:" area.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Removed the signal handler that handled the value being changed
          in the focus tracking mode combo box.

2006-05-03  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/bugs/bugs.html: Add GEdit bug 340577 regarding inability
        to get to statusbar information from at-poke.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
        src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 340559, handle sliders with
        text values a little better.

        * src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py,
        src/orca/default.py, src/orca/flat_review.py,
        src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/mag.py,
        src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/speechserver.py,
        src/orca/util.py, src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py,
        src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py: move ".label" logic from atspi to
        speech and braille generators to address bug 319732.  Fixed a few
        other bugs in the process: bug 337371 (voluminous output of
        sliders), 340481 (combo box in gaim), and bug 340556 (radio button
        group names not being announced).

        * src/orca/mag.py, src/orca/settings.py: some experimentation with
        property bags as well as setting magnification scales.

2006-05-03  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Added in commented out code to _initGUIState() to set the
          initial state of the various components on the Magnifier
          notebook page. When the names of the various magnifier
          preferences are known, then this code can be uncommented.

          Added in a _getComboBoxIndex() method that will return the
          index of the first entry in a given combobox with a given label.
          This will be needed by the new code in _initGUIState().

2006-05-03  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Added in the GUI for the Magnification notebook page in
          the configuration window.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Added in stub signal handlers for all the values that
          can change in the components on the Magnification notebook
          page in the configuration GUI.

2006-05-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py
          The showing of the Orca configuration GUI (if invoked at
          startup time via --setup or --gui-setup), needed to happen
          after the users current orca settings had been read.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          In the speechSystemChanged() method, the existing entries
          in the voices combo box needed to be removed before
          _setupVoices() was called.

2006-05-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: per request of Mike, make Insert+s be a
        toggle for disabling/enabling speech.  Fixes bug 338839.

        * src/orca/default.py: generalize fix for 340305.

2006-05-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: ultimate fix for 340305.  The underlying
        problem is that the selection notification event from the AT-SPI
        Registry can keep giving us a different object for the same combo
        box as you arrow up and down in the combo box items.  This seems
        to happen each time you run the test case in the bug report except
        for the very first time.  The fix is more general in that it
        adds an additional check in visualAppearanceChanged to see if
        the given object is the locusOfFocus *or* if it has the FOCUSED
        state set.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
        src/orca/default.py, src/orca/util.py: partial fix for 340305.
        Changes the way labels and displayed text for combo boxes are
        obtained.  Also handles selection events to better react when
        the selection in a combo box changes.

2006-05-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Added comments to each method in the file.

2006-05-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          All methods in orca_gui_prefs.py that are just used internally
          have had an underscore prepended to their names.

2006-04-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * po/POTFILES.in: add orca_gui_prefs and orca_console_prefs.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py,
        src/orca/settings.py, src/orca/speech.py,
        src/orca/speechserver.py: Add "Insert+s" to temporarily disable
        speech and "Insert+q" to re-enable speech.

        * src/orca/dectalk.py, src/orca/espeechfactory.py,
        src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py,src/orca/orca.py,
        src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py, src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py,
        src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/speechserver.py: refactor
        speech server factory to remove the "Infos" stuff and
        give you back working servers insteaed.

        * src/orca/orca.py: fix for bug 339932 to shutdown speech
        better and also force exit (use os._exit instead of sys.exit).

2006-04-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Changed all occurances of GtkComboBoxEntry for GtkComboBox.

          Added LABEL_FOR and LABELLED relationships for the speech
          punctuation level and speech verbosity label/radio buttons.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Adjusted the code handling the GtkComboEntry components to now
          use GtkComboBoxes instead.

2006-04-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Added LABEL_FOR and LABELLED_BY relationships for the
          label/scales for rate, pitch and volume.

2006-04-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          If the user now dismisses the Orca configuration GUI via the
          Close "X" glyph on the window titlebar, the GUI will now be
          correctly redisplayed the next time they hit Insert-Space.

2006-04-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Fixed up the setting of family, rate, pitch and volume for each
          of the three voice types (default, uppercase, hyperlink). The
          correct values are now read and written from the users
          ~/.orca/user-settings.py file.

2006-04-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py
          Added in support for speech punctuation style.
          Keyword is "verbalizePunctuationStyle". There are three
          new definitions:
            PUNCTUATION_STYLE_NONE = 0
            PUNCTUATION_STYLE_SOME = 1
            PUNCTUATION_STYLE_ALL  = 2

         * src/orca/orca_prefs.py
           Added in a new routine:
             _getVerbalizePunctuationStyleString(punctuationStyle):
           that returns a string that represents the punctuation
           style passed in.

           Adjusted the writePreferences() routine to use it.

         * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
           Added in support for reading and writing the speech
           punctuation style preference.

2006-04-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Moved the voice family down into the Voice Settings area.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Implemented voiceTypeChanged(), rateValueChanged(),
          pitchValueChanged() and volumeValueChanged()

2006-04-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Hooked up the callbacks for:
          - Speech Verbosity Level
          - Braille Abbreviated Rolenames
          - Braille Verbosity Level

2006-04-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Further changes to the Orca Configuration GUI.
          - Three GtkTreeView lists removed.
          - Scrolling window in the Speech Notebook pane has been removed.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Adjusted code to use GtkComboBox's instead of GtkTreeView lists.

2006-04-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Further changes to the Orca Configuration GUI.
          - Step increment for volume scale is now .1
          - Added in controls for:
            > Speech Punctuation Level
            > Speech Verbosity
            > Braille Abbreviated Rolenames
            > Braille Verbosity Level.
          - Added a scrollwindow for the Speech notebook pane and reduced
            the initial height of the configuration window.
          - Reduced padding from 5 to 3 pixels in most cases.
          - Added some horizontal separators.
          - Changed the window title to "Orca Preferences".

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Added stub callbacks for the new controls in the Glade GUI.

2006-04-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          From Will: code in setupServers() to handle the situation where
          there are two or more speech systems installed.

2006-04-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: fix for bug 339927: force
        floating point values on rate, gain, pitch, etc. to prevent
        integer arithmetic from getting in the way.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: print the ImportException
        out at a debug level of ALL when attempting to find script
        modules.  The reason for this is that the script module itself
        might have import problems and we want to know what they are.

2006-04-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Adjusted the scale increment for the pitch scale from 1 to .1.

2006-04-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Added in the GUI for setting the rate, pitch and volume for
          the three types of voice (default, uppercase and hyperlink).

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Needed to adjust the recently added debug messages to _init(),
          setupServers() and setupVoices(), so that they are only output
          if debugLevel is <= debug.LEVEL_FINEST not >= debug.LEVEL_FINEST.

2006-04-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Changed "Select desired voice" to "Select desired voice family"
          for the label of the third list in the Speech tab pane.

2006-04-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Added in debug to the _init(), setupServers() and setupVoices()
          methods to help debug cases where the GUI speech lists aren't
          being setup correctly.

2006-04-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Added LABEL_FOR relationships (to the appropriate lists) for
          the three speech related labels in the Speech Tab pane.
          Added mnemonics to the Help, Apply and Cancel buttons.
          Made the Apply button the default.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          The printing of the stack trace in the three places where
          speech is not available has been set to debug.LEVEL_FINEST.

2006-04-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py: i18n-ize the message
        regarding needing to log out and back in again if a11y
        was just enabled.

2006-04-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          The initial selections in the the three lists on the Speech
          tab GUI are now correctly set.

2006-04-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py
          Adjusted _loadUserSettings() to loadUserSettings() so that it
          can be used in the Orca GUI configuration.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Call orca.loadUserSettings() to dynamically load the new user
          settings when they click on the Apply button.

2006-04-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Set Help button insensitive until callback has been implemented.

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Replaced most uses of the say() routine with calls to debug
          routines.

          Added gettext wrappers around several strings.

2006-04-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Changed alphaPunctCheckButton to printableCheckButton for a
          consistent naming scheme with the variables in orca_gui_prefs.py

        * src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py
          Initial version of the GUI embedded in Orca, using the common
          routines in orca_prefs.py. See the TODO comments at the start
          of this file for a list of the things that still need to be
          completed.

2006-04-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: use Insert+space instead of Insert+s for
        settings.  Insert+s is reserved for the stop speaking functionality.

        * src/orca/orca.py: add "--setup" as a synonym for "--gui-setup".
        Note that this will fallback to "--text-setup" if the desktop is
        not running.  Also do Insert+control+space for doing a forced
        reloading of the settings.

        * src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py, src/orca/orca_prefs.py: allow
        writing of things besides strings.  Also add ability to preload
        a preferences dictionary based upon the current settings.

        * src/orca/settings.py: add "userCustomizableSettings" field to
        specify what is user customizable.

        * orca.spec.in, configure.in, src/orca/.cvsignore,
        src/orca/orca-setup.in (DELETE), src/orca/orca.py,
        src/orca/orca_gui_prefs.py (GUI stuff from orca-setup.in),
        src/orca/orca_console_prefs.py (console stuff from orca-setup.in),
        src/orca/orca_prefs.py (common stuff from orca-setup.in):
        Refactor of preferences setting mechanisms.  These are now
        invoked via command line options to the "orca" command.
        "--gui-setup" will run the GUI setup tool (also available via
        Insert+s when Orca is running) and "--text-setup" will run the
        console based tool.  orca-seutp.in no longer exists.

2006-04-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * configure.in, src/orca/platform.py.in: create a new module
        to hold platform settings used when ./autogen.sh or ./configure
        was run.  This will hold the prefix, datadirname, package name,
        orca version, etc.  The goal here is to get rid of the various
        *.py.in files and use this one as the single point of reference
        for the various settings on the platform.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py: support to load the
        configUIModule and call showConfigUI if "--configure" is passed to
        the orca command line and also do the same if the user presses
        Insert+s.  This will only work once Rich checks in the
        orca-config.py module, so don't bother trying it yet. :-)

2006-04-24  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Adjusted one of the labels on the Speech tab pane from
          "Selected..." to "Select ..."

2006-04-24  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in
          Hopefully the real fix to the systemsSelectionChanged() method.
          Was not passing in a proper gnome speech factory parameter to
          the setupServers() routine.

2006-04-24  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in
          Removed the line that says "Welcome to Orca setup."
          This will automatically be spoken as one of the static labels
          in the Orca configuration window.

          Removed the lines of code that set the speech list panes
          insensitive if they only had one item in them.

          Added in a check to the systemsSelectionChanged() method to see
          if there was only one speech system. If so, then just return.
          This is just a hack to make it useful for the common situation.
          The real fix is to work out how to change/reinstall a factory.

2006-04-24  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * po/POTFILES.in
          Added src/orca/orca-setup.glade to the list of files that
          should be checked for translatable strings.

2006-04-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for 0.2.3.

        * po/POTFILES.in: remove Gecko.py.

        * configure.in: get the ORCA_SETUP_GLADE_DIR working better.

        * src/orca/mag.py: minor attempt to follow the caret when it
        moves.

2006-04-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          Removed three unwanted "label-for" relationships from the
          orca-setup Glade file.

2006-04-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in
          Adjusted the nonGui() side of orca-setup to ask the question:
          "Enable Braille?  Enter y or n: ", rather than always set it
          to True. Removed the now redundant seupBraille() routine.

2006-04-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * configure.in
          src/orca/Makefile.am
          src/orca/orca-setup.glade
          src/orca/orca-setup.in
          Created an initial version of a GUI for Orca configuration.
          At the moment, if you run "orca-setup", it will default to
          the command line version and will ask you a series of questions.
          If you start it with "orca-setup -gui", then it will bring up
          a GUI equivalent.

          There is still work to do on this before it can be announced
          on the Orca mailing list. When it's ready, the plan is to swap
          the default behaviour (i.e. no command line options) to be the
          GUI version. The command line version would still be available
          via a "-nogui" command line option.

        * bugs/bugs.html, bugs/bug_312093.py (new): update based upon
        Firefox 2.0a1 nightly from 2006-04-20.

2006-04-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 338687 - no longer
        automatically speaks unbound text in panels that suddenly appear.
        NOTE that Orca will still automatically speak dialogs and such.
        NOTE ALSO that this fix probably breaks wizard dialogs, but wizards
        are so broken, anyway, that I think they need to be handled a little
        differently.

        * src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/settings.py: fix for bug 334924 to
        keep the cache in better sync.  Also use settings.cacheValues
        setting instead of atspi.CACHE_VALUES to allow easier setting
        and unsetting of whether to cache or not.

        * src/orca/default.py: more work for bug 319643. Magnification is
        working again, though it does indeed need a bit of work to make it
        usable.  See also http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=323032.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/mag.py: patch for bug 319643 - recover
        gracefully from failures when attempting to load the magnifier.
        This allows Orca to work if gnome-mag had not been installed.

        * src/orca/rolenames.py, src/orca/atspi.py,
        src/orca/scripts/gedit.py, src/orca/scripts/gaim.py: fix for bug
        319789 - fallback to localized rolename if it exists.

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in: fix for bug 330631 - put rate, gain,
        and pitch in user-settings.py.

        * src/orca/orca.py: fix for bug 319651 - issue a message and abort
        orca if accessibility has not been enabled for the session.

        * src/orca/debug.py: update documentation to reflect new way to
        set debugLevel.

        * test/harness/user-settings.py.in: update to reflect new settings
        and new method for setting settings.

2006-04-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca_i18n.py.in: fix for bug 338690: orca_i18n was not
        working as expected.

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/util.py,
        src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py, src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py: make
        sayLine, sayWord, and sayCharacter be object methods as opposed to
        top level module methods.  Also move textLines and getLinkIndex
        methods from default.py to util.py. These changes merely reflect a
        small cleanup of the object-oriented nature of the code and should
        not have any impact on the end user experience.

2006-04-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: provide some delimiter
        output to make it easier to identify the various processing
        steps that are done when an event is processed.

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/scripts/gnome-terminal.py:
        remove some speech output.  This seems to eliminate hearing
        "terminal" 6 times, but it does not address the repetitive stuff
        that's going on when you go through the profile editing tabs.

        * src/orca/orca.py: delay registration of keyboard listeners until
        after the user preferences have been loaded.  This prevents
        exceptions from occurring if the user types on the keyboard in
        between the time the user starts orca and the time orca is fully
        initialized.

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in: remove an errant ")" at the end of a
        commented out debug line.

2006-04-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/*.py, src/orca/scripts/*.py: general pass at
        removing trailing whitespace from source code, removing
        tabs, and making sure copyrights are up to date.

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/script.py,
        src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py, src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py,
        src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py, src/orca/scripts/gcalctool.py,
        src/orca/scripts/gdmlogin.py, src/orca/scripts/gedit.py,
        src/orca/scripts/gnome-terminal.py, src/orca/scripts/metacity.py,
        src/orca/scripts/planner.py: break HUGE default.py:__init__
        method up and provide 4 new methods to script.py:

        setupInputEventHandlers: sets up input event handlers for a script
        getListeners: returns dictionary of AT-SPI event listeners
        getKeyBindings: returns keybindings that define which keystrokes
                        call which input event handlers
        getBrailleBindings: returns braillebindings that define which
                        braille input events call which input event
                        handlers

        This change allows subclasses to more easily define and override
        the various features.

2006-04-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/atspi.py: pass
        one at bug 334893.  This patch adds the knowledge of the toolkit
        name and version to an Accessible's application.  In the event
        that a custom script cannot be found for an application, this
        patch also attempts to load a script module based upon the toolkit
        name before falling back to the default script.  The main
        restriction of this patch is that it does not allow one to
        override the toolkit module (i.e., settings.scriptPackages is not
        used) and the toolkit module must be in the "orca" package.  This
        probably should be relaxed at some point, but I'm not comfortable
        with mixing toolkit scripts and application scripts in the same
        packages because of potential Python namespace conflicts (e.g., an
        application written in Java named "GAIL" and an application
        written using the GAIL toolkit might accidentally both end up
        using the GAIL script).

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py,

        src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py,
        src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py: fix for bug 338240 to refactor the
        way user-settings are managed.  This new method removes the
        two-tier approach and has user-settings.py set values in
        settings.py.  It also isolates the default values to settings.py
        and removes a fair amount of complexity.  Furthermore, this
        includes nascent support (Insert+Ctrl+s) to allow the user to
        dynamically reload user-settings.py should they edit it while Orca
        is running.  The reload will also restart speech and braille.

2006-04-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          src/orca/orca.py
          In the _keyEcho() routine in orca.py, no longer do anything
          special if this is a printable character and a "special"
          component ("special" is an editable component or a terminal).

          In the onTextInserted() routine in default.py, check if the
          last input event was a keyboard event, check to see if the
          text for this event matches what the user typed. If it does,
          then don't speak it.

           Note that we have to special case the space character as it
           comes across as "space" in the keyboard event and " " in the
           text event.

2006-04-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Added code to the onTextInserted() method to say the last word
          when "echo by word" is enabled. Note that it's not speaking the
          punctuation or whitespace after the word at the moment. That
          will require some changes to the sayWord() method.

2006-04-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/settings.py
          src/orca/orca.py
          src/orca/default.py
          src/orca/orca-setup.in
          Changes to the way key echo work per the key and word echo
          requirements spec.

          Key echo applies to the entire keyboard and is for echoing
          keys as they are pressed. The keys are broken into the following
          groups that the user can optionally enable for echoing:

          o Alphanumeric and punctuation keys

          o Modifier keys: CTRL, ALT, Shift, Insert, and "Fn" on laptops.

          o Locking keys: Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock, etc.

          o Function keys: The keys at the top of the keyboard.

          o Action keys: space, enter, escape, tab, backspace, delete, arrow
            keys, page up, page down, etc.

          When a key from any enabled group is pressed, the key will
          be spoken.

          The onTextInserted() method only speaks the text associated
          with the "object:text-change:insert" event if key echoing and
          echoing of printable characters are both enabled.

          The orca-setup.in script has been adjusted to ask various questions
          to allow the user to setup whether these types of keys will be
          echoed or not.

        * src/orca/settings.py
          src/orca/braille.py
          src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py
          src/orca/orca.py
          src/orca/orca-setup.in
          Refactoring of use<name> to enable<name> for various settings to
          be consistent in style with the names for the new keyboard
          enabling types.

          The orca-setup.in script has been adjusted to use these new names.

2006-04-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * docs/doc-set/*: update requirements

2006-04-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/planner.py: use new braille API to for
        displayRegions and also handle the label a little better.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py: fix for bug 337857,
        allow user to customize which key(s) can be used as the Orca
        modifier key.

        * po/POTFILES.in: add gedit and utils.

2006-04-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
        src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py: fix for bug 337704 - add API
        symmetry to braillegenerator.py:getBrailleRegions and
        braille.py:displayRegions.

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in: fix for RFE (bug 337709) - force
        speaking rate parameter to be added to ACSS for default force.

2006-04-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Small change to the onTextInserted() method as part of the
          key echo revamp. If echoing by character and word are both
          off, then just return and don't speak anything.

          [Update: change removed for now as it has the side-effect
           of no longer speaking any text that's inserted into the gedit or
           gnome-terminal application. Need to find out how to determine
           whether this "object:text-changed:insert" event was generated
           as the result of a key being pressed.]

2006-04-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added in the following GNOME planner bug:

          http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=337659
          Planner Edit Task Properties dialog has broken accessible
          component hierarchy.

2006-04-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/planner.py
          Adjustment to case #1 in the onFocus() method, to also add
          the label for the toggle button to the braille display.

2006-04-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in
          Several changes to the orca-setup script:
          - Removed the "Use key echo?" question and associated
            orca.settings.USE_KEY_ECHO setting.
          - Replaced it with:
            "Echo by word, character, both or none?  Enter w, c, b or n: "
            which  will set two settings to True or False:
              orca.settings.USE_ECHO_BY_WORD
              orca.settings.USE_ECHO_BY_CHAR
            depending upon the users answer.
          - Added in another question: "Use Braille Monitor?  Enter y or n: ".
            The Braille Monitor is a visual representation of what is being
            brailled by Orca.
          - Automatically create a "orca-scripts" directory under the
            users .orca directory, if it doesn't already exist.
          - Automatically create an empty __init__.py file in the
            orca-scripts directory, if it doesn't already exist.
            This will enable the user to put their own specific
            applications scripts in the orca-scripts directory,
            and Orca will pick them up.
          - Added a section of code that will generate the following lines
            at the end of the user's user-settings.py file:

              try:
                  __import__("orca-customizations")
              except ImportError:
                  pass

            What this means is that Orca will now look for a file
            called "orca-customizations.py" in the user's .orca directory.
            This file should contain any custom Orca Python code that the
            user wants. Having it in a separate file from user-settings.py
            means it won't get blown away when you rerun orca-setup

2006-04-06  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py
          Added in two sections of code in _keyEcho():
          - check to see if the key event is for a "special" key (via
            the new _specialKey method) and if so, then handle its
            echoing in the _keyEcho method. Currently this is just testing
            for Control, Alt, Shift and Meta. Over time, this routine
            will be tweaked to handle the full set of special keys.

          - check to see if the object that currently has focus is an
            editable text object or has a role of "terminal". If so, and
            its not a special key, then the echoing of the key event will
            occur via an "object:text-changed:insert" event.

          This improves the double echoing that was previously happening.

2006-04-06  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py
          Slight refactoring to move some keyboard echo code out of
          _processKeyboardEvent() and  into the _keyEcho() method.
          _keyEcho() now takes an event (AT-SPI DeviceEvent) parameter
          rather than an event_string so that at a later date, we can
          fully interrogate the keyboard event we've just received.

2006-04-06  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/planner.py src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          src/orca/scripts/planner.py src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted case #1 in the onFocus() method in the planner.py
          script, to fall through and also do the default action for
          the focus event.

          Removed the walkComponentHierarchy() from the planner,
          Evolution, StarOffice and gedit scripts and used calls to
          atspi.printAncestry(event.source) instead.

2006-04-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/atspi.py,
        src/orca/hierarchical_presenter.py, src/orca/scripts/metacity.py:
        fix for bug 337489 where metacity script would inappropriately
        think apps that started after Orca started were inaccessible.

2006-04-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, orca/src/settings.py: fix
        for bug 337322 where the user was not being notified of window
        title changes when the user uses Alt+TAB to tab between windows.
        The primary culprit was name space pollution by GTK, but Orca
        should sheild itself from this.  This fix provides that shield
        somewhat, but the ramification is that scripts are no longer
        picked up from the local directory (which was just a convenience
        for script writers).

        * docs/doc-set/*.{sgml,html,pdf}: make this compile again.  For
        some bizarre reason, docbook on my Ubuntu box no longer liked "_"
        in entities or ids, and it was easier to get rid of them rather
        than scour the web to see what was going wrong.

2006-04-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py
          Changes to the __get_label() method. The check to see if the
          object has a name (and if so, return it), has been moved to
          the beginning. The improves the readibility of checkboxes on
          various StarOffice options dialog panes.

          The special case code for push buttons with children, has been
          adjusted to no longer first check to see if the push button has
          a name.

2006-04-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Couple of changes to the visualAppearanceChanged() method.

          1/ If this object is CONTROLLED_BY the object that currently
             has focus, speak/braille this object.

          2/ If this object is a label, and if it has a LABEL_FOR relation
             to the focused object, then we should speak/braille the
             focused object, as if it had just got focus.

2006-04-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added in the following GNOME planner bug:

          Toggle button in main window not accessible</td>

          Also fixed up the table of OpenOffice bugs.

        * src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am
          src/orca/scripts/planner.py    (new)
          Created a new planner.py script for the Planner application.
          Currently it looks to see if the focus is on one of the four
          graphical toggle buttons on the left side of the main window
          and if so, speaks the label associated with it.

2006-04-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added the following new OpenOffice bugs:

2006-03-31  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added two new Open Office bugs:

        * src/orca/util.py
          src/orca/scripts/gedit.py
          src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Created a speakMisspeltWord(allTokens, badWord) routine in
          util.py that is now used by the spell checking code for the
          gedit, Evolution and StarOffice scripts.

2006-03-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in
          Fix for bug #336648 (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=336648)
          The orca-setup script now successfully completed speaking
          "Orca setup finished" before the speech server is shutdown.

2006-03-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gedit.py
          Added in spell checking support. The misspelt word and its
          context are now spoken in a similar way to the StarOffice and
          Evolution scripts.

          NOTE: this will currently only work correctly if you turn:
                CACHE_VALUES = False
                in atspi.py. See Orca bug #334924 for more details
                (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=334924).

2006-03-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added an entry for OpenOffice Writer bug #63818:
          F10 key doesn't bring up the menu bar.

2006-03-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Change to the readMisspeltWord() routine to only braille (not
          speak) the default action for this component.

2006-03-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Changes to the readMisspeltWord() routine to:
          - Only braille (not speak) the default action for this component.
          - Handle misspelt words at the end of the line.
          - Don't respeak the mispelt word and context when tabbing around
            inside the Spell Checker Dialog.

2006-03-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/rolenames.py
          Fix for bug #330487
          Typo in one of the strings in the rolenames[ROLE_DRAWING_AREA]
          rolename entry.

2006-03-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted the "A.M." and "P.M." suffix occurances in the
          getTimeForCalRow() routine to remove references to urine.

2006-03-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for 0.2.2.

2006-03-17  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Slight adjustment to the spell checking routines. Needed to
          check if each word in the text area starts with the bad word
          rather than is exactly equal to it. The latter wasn't taken
          into consideration any possible punctuation symbols.

2006-03-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: triage/update based upon GNOME 2.14.

2006-03-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Slight tweak to the previous change. Always speak the text
          attributes for size and family-name. For the others, if the
          value is the default, then ignore it.

2006-03-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Added in a new hotkey combination (Insert+f), that will speak
          a set of text attributes (indent, underline, strikethrough, size,
          family-name, justification and style) for the character at the
          text caret offset.

          Three new methods created:

              textAttrsToDictionary(str):
              outputCharAttributes(attributes):
              readCharAttributes(inputEvent=None):

         Note that it looks like some applications like Evolution and Star
         Office don't implement text.getDefaultAttributes(). This means
         that we can't always determine the full set of text attributes.

2006-03-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in: make hyperlink voice more
        distinguishable from the normal speaking voice

        * src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py: do a bit of work with better
        handling of hyperlinks

2006-03-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/brlmon.py: use window manager struts property to
        keep other windows from occluding the brlmon and to push
        them out of the way if necessary.

        * src/orca/util.py: add findFocusedObject method to find the
        focused object under a given root.

        * src/orca/scripts/gdmlogin.py, src/orca/gnome-terminal.py: use
        the util.findFocusedObject method on window activated events.

2006-03-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am, src/orca/scripts/gdmlogin.py:
        simple script to speak the text area with focus when Orca is
        started.

2006-03-13  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Adjustment to clause #1 of the onFocus() method to check to see
          if the current paragraph contains one or more hypertext links.
          If it does, then those words containing the links are spoken with
          the HYPERTEXT voice and the word "link" is spoken after them.

2006-03-13  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Added in support for spell checking when there is more than one
          misspelt word on the same line. Also handles the situation where we
          are getting more than one "object:property-change:accessible-name"
          event for the same misspelt word.

2006-03-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: toss out all children remove
        events unless they are for the desktop.  This is an attempt to deal
        with bursty event behavior for events we may not always care about.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: stub in
        some experimental timer code.  It's commented out for now, but the
        goal is to try to detect hangs in AT-SPI calls.

2006-03-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/brlmon.py: Better adaptation (e.g. position on screen)
        to changes in size when working with large fonts (e.g., enlarging
        the fonts for presentation purposes).

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py, src/orca/braille.py: transform
        unicode ellipses into "...".  Fixes bug 333915.

2006-03-07  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: disable the automatic updating of the apps
        list.  This was often hanging Orca and the desktop, especially
        in the instances where the gnome error window of death would
        appear.  NOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY A TEMPORARY THING: It helps
        avoid some hangs, but it also required the disabling of the
        hierarchical presentation manager, which is rarely, if ever,
        used.

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: unref speech engines that fail
        to initialize.  This will give them a chance to exit.  Fixes
        bug 333792.

        * src/orca/orca.py: add more signal handling logic to attempt to
        shutdown gracefully under adverse conditions.  This helps address
        bug 333765.

2006-03-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py, src/orca/orca-setup.in:
        turn braille on by default; Orca will fail gracefully if it cannot
        connect to BrlTTY.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/orca.py: handle
        COMM_FAILURE's better when looking at children of the desktop.

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: In speech, add a space after all
        instances of "[" in a string as a means to prevent DECtalk from
        interpreting these as commands.  This is an interim fix, and I'm
        not sure whether the real fix belongs in the dectalk driver for
        gnome-speech or in Orca.

2006-03-03  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Added a new clause to the onFocus() method.

          2) Writer: spell checking dialog.

          Check to see if the Spell Check dialog has just appeared and got
          focus. If it has, then it contains a "paragraph" which shows the
          context for the current spelling mistake. After speaking/brailling
          the default action for this component, that a selection of the
          surronding text from that paragraph with the misspelt word is also
          spoken.

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          The number of words spoken in the surronding text for misspelt
          words was one less than it should have been.

2006-03-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py
          Adjusted the _getSpeechForTableCell() method to check to see
          if the table cell implemented the accessible text interface,
          and if so, to append that text to the list of spoken utterances
          (if that text was different than the label of the table cell).

2006-03-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          A tweak to clause 3) in the onFocus() method (Mail view:
          message header list). The column header is only spoken and
          brailled when moving by row, if this is the table cell that
          currently has focus.

2006-03-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added an entry for the StarOffice/OpenOffice bug #62723.
          Open Dialog "read-only" checkbox has incorrect accessibility
          information.

2006-03-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/script.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
        patch for bug 333168: scripts were not being reclaimed.  This
        is an acceptable workaround, but we should (not must) determine
        circular references and why they exist.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py: add ARMED state as a means for
        identifying selected items when considering which item to show
        from a set of grouped items.  This is to work around the way
        OpenOffice currently exposes selected menu items.  If/when they
        fix this to match GTK's method, this code should still continue
        to work and not cause side effects (I hope).

        * src/orca/atspi.py: do not cache the accessible state because
        I'm not sure we are getting the appropriate events to allow us
        to keep our state cache in sync.

2006-03-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: fix for bug 332887 - added extra KeySyms
        to accommodate different keypad layouts on Solaris systems.

2006-02-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/util.py src/orca/Makefile.am
          src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Created a new util.py file which will contain various utility
          functions used by Orca. Moved the isDesiredFocusedItem() routine
          there and adjusted Evolution.py and StarOffice.py accordingly.

2006-02-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py
          Added an onFocus() method and handled the following situation:

          When the focus is on a paragraph in the Document view of the Writer,
          then just speak/braille the current line (rather than speaking a
          bogus initial "paragraph" utterance as well).

        * src/orca/braille.py
          The initial parameter of the call to displayRegionsWithFocus()
          within the displayRegions() method should have been "regions" not
          "region".

2006-02-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: handle fallback for broken
        speech drivers a little better - gnome-speech may tell us a
        driver is available when, in fact, the engine behind it is
        not working.

2006-02-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * NEWS, configure.in, README: prep for 0.2.1.

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py, src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/orca.py,
        src/orca/speechserver.py: add keystroke to reset speech: Insert+s.
        Interim workaround for bug 332253.

2006-02-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/brlmon.py: "improve" visibility of cell with cursor.

        * src/orca/brlmon.py: substitute macros for < and & so they are
        not interpreted by the pango interpreter.

        * src/orca/orca.py: add SIGSEGV handler to (hopefully) prevent
        core files.

2006-02-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>
        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added a new entry for Evolution bug #331447:
          The accessible name for Mail message header list "checkbox" table
          cells is not useful.

2006-02-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          A couple of tweaks to clause 3) in the onFocus() method
          (Mail view: message header list).
          - It no longer speaks/brailles the headers for checkboxes. A side
            effect of this is that if the current cell with focus was a
            checkbox, then the region on the braille line that's visible
            now becomes the actual cell itself rather than the header.
          - Added spaces between each header and cell value.

2006-02-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted clause 3) in the onFocus() method (Mail view: message
          header list). It now speaks/brailles (with VERBOSITY_BRIEF) the
          column headers for each table cell that is read in the current
          row of the mail message header list. The focus in the braille
          line is given to the region containing that column header
          information for the current cell now, rather then the actual
          table cell.

2006-02-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted clause 3) in the onFocus() method (Mail view: message
          header list). It now uses the new displayRegionsWithFocus()
          method to (hopefully) correctly set the correct region to set
          the focus to on the braille line.

2006-02-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/settings.py,
        src/orca/brlmon.py: add beginnings of a braille monitor.  This is
        currently turned off by default, but can be enabled by setting
        useBrailleMonitor=True in ~/.orca/user-settings.py.

        * src/orca/braille.py: refactor displayRegions to include a
        new method, displayRegionsWithFocus, which will set the cursor
        to a given region with focus.  The new displayRegions method
        merely calls this new method with the region as specified by
        the indexOfFocusRegion parameter.

2006-02-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * QUICKSTART: update to include Ubuntu notes on building eel,
        evolution-data-server, and evolution.  Also re-order libgail-gnome
        and at-spi building - turns out that libgail-gnome depends upon
        at-spi's spi.

2006-02-14  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted the 3) clause in the onFocus() method (Mail view: message
          header list). The last column (as well as the last row) in the
          message header list is now cached. Now, in order to speak the
          whole message header, the row must have changed or we are on the
          first or last message header in the list and the column number
          hasn't changed.

2006-02-14 Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py
          Removed the auto-speaking of scrollpanes as they don't give
          any value-add to the speech user.

2006-02-10  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py: _getSpeechForLabelAndRole
          src/orca/braillegenerator.py: _getDefaultBrailleRegions
          If we are being verbose, don't speak/braille the rolename
          if the role of the object is UNKNOWN (unless the obj has no
          label).

2006-02-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/settings.py:
        add "null" package to list of packages to search for scripts.
        This allows you to pick up a script from the directory where
        you run orca so you can more easily test your scripts.

2006-02-10  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added a new entry for Evolution bug #330712
          Accessible Name for TimeZone Button shouldn't contain its role.

          Added a new entry for Evolution bug #330723
          Various components shouldn't include their role in their
          accessible name.

2006-02-09  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added a new 10) "Mail view: message area - attachments"
          clause to the onFocus() method:

          Check if the focus is on the "go forward" button or the
          "attachment button" for an attachment in the mail message
          attachment area. (There will be a pair of these buttons
          for each attachment in the mail message).

          If it is, then get the text which describes the current
          attachment and speak it after doing the default action
          for the button.

          NOTE: it is assumed that the last table cell in the table
          contains this information.

2006-02-09  Clytie Siddall <clytie@riverland.net.au>

        * configure.in  Added vi in ALL_LINGUAS line.

2006-02-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted the 3) "Mail view: message header list" clause in
          the onFocus() method:

          - If this focus event is just for a different table cell on
            the same row as last time, then we just speak the current
            cell.
          - The braille cursor to set to point to the current cell.
          - If a table check is a check box, and we've just moved the
            focus to the left or right on the same row, then it's now
            read (spoken/brailled) irrespective of whether it's checked
            or not.

2006-02-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: interim workaround for Orca not speaking
        Contact Source Selector panel items properly in Evolution.

        * bugs/bugs.html: update with information from OOo.

        * bugs/bug_330454.py, bugs/bugs.html: update with new FOCUSED
        state oddess for Evolution.

        * src/orca/settings.py: internationalize regular expressions for
        script mappings.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
        src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py: start treating PARAGRAPH objects
        like TEXT objects.  Also rip out the earlier StarOffice script
        logic now that the new UNO<->ATK bridge implementation is looking
        better.

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py: remove traceback when a chname
        cannot be found - it's really not a bad thing.

2006-02-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added in another couple of scenerios to the onFocus() method.

          - Mail compose window: message area

            This works in conjunction with code in the next section.
            Check to see if focus is currently in the Mail compose window
            message area. If it is, then, if this is the first time, save
            a pointer to the HTML panel that will contain a variety of
            components that will, in turn, contain the message text.

          - Spell Checking Dialog

            This works in conjunction with code in the previous section.
            Check to see if current focus is in the table of possible
            replacement words in the spell checking dialog. If it is,
            then we use a cached handle to the Mail compose window message
            area, to find out where the text caret currently is, and use
            this to speak a selection of the surrounding text, to give
            the user context for the current misspelt word.

2006-02-06  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py
          Adjusted the __get_child_count() and __get_index() methods
          to no longer cache their values, as they could potentially change.

2006-02-06  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Adjusted the entry for "bug #329269" to show that it's not a bug
          and to give the required keynav sequence (Alt+Down Arrow).

2006-02-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * test/harness/runall.sh, test/harness/runone.sh: do not
        override user's user-settings.py when running tests.  Also
        sort the keystrokes files alphabetically before running.
        Finally attempt to politely tell Orca and other test utils
        (event_listener) to quit before running another test.

        * src/orca/orca.py: add current working directory to the
        beginning of sys.path - this is primarily for picking up
        a user-settings.py from the local directory for the purposes
        of running tests

        * src/orca/debug.py: remove gtk dependency

        * src/orca/settings.py: add script mapping for soffice.bin

        * src/orca/atspi.py: use EventDetails.host_application if
        it is available (this was added for AT-SPI 1.7.0)

2006-02-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * test/harness/*: add some initial attempt at a test harness.
        runall.sh runs them all, runone.sh runs one.  There's still
        issues with a different set of events coming from running the
        same test on the same system - it's most likely due to
        differences in timing when handling keystrokes.

        * test/keystrokes/*: arrange keystroke files in directories,
        with one directory per application.

2006-02-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py: _getSpeechForComboBox
          src/orca/braillegenerator.py: _getBrailleRegionsForComboBox
          If the label of the combo box is the same as the utterance for
          the child object, then this utterance is only spoken/brailled once.

2006-02-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted the default for Evolution, to read all table cells
          (such as in the mail message header summary list).

          Put a gettext wrapper around the "No appointments" string in the
          onFocus() method (case 5).

        * Added a case 7) to the onFocus() method:

        * This is for Mail view: insert attachment dialog: unlabelled arrow
          button. Check if the focus is on the unlabelled arrow button near
          the top of the mail view Insert Attachment dialog. If it is, then
          rather than just speak/braille "button", output something a
          little more useful.

2006-01-31  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted section 3) in the onFocus() method (reading mail message
          header summary items). It now checks if the current table cell
          is a check box. If it is, then to reduce verbosity, it only speaks
          and brailles it, if it's checked.

2006-01-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added entries for Evolution bugs 329269 and 329270.

2006-01-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/bugs/bugs.html: Add gail infinite recursion bug 329230.

        * ChangeLog: fix 2006/2005 typos.  :-)

2006-01-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py: prevent infinite loop if obj.parent == parent.
        (This case is an AT-SPI bug, but we need to watch for it).

        * bugs/bugs.html: update to reflect bug entry information provided
        to us by external development teams.

        * src/orca/atspi.py: more work resulting from incompatible
        event data structure change in AT-SPI 1.7.0.

        * src/orca/atspi.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py:
        change some ominous looking Traceback messages to what they
        really are: just information regarding normal behavior.

2006-01-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * QUICKSTART: update Ubuntu notes for how to get older/supported
        releases of AT-SPI infrastructure.

2006-01-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Changed bug #324002 to now be an entry for bug #318973.
          Updated the notes section for that bug.

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Summary for bug #326725 has changed.

2006-01-25  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html bugs/bug_326725.py
          Changed bug #328493 to now be an entry for bug #326725.
          Updated the notes section for that bug.

          Added in bug_326725.py to help track down this problem.

2006-01-25  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Updated the notes section for bug #328493

2006-01-24  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added a new bug #328493
          Broken component hierarchy in compose window message area.

2006-01-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: be a bit more vocal
        when importing a script with syntax errors

        * src/orca/atspi.py: handle both AT-SPI 1.7.0+ and pre-1.7.0
        event "any_data" handling.

2006-01-23  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Updated entry for bug #326649. Fix is in CVS HEAD.

2006-01-18  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py: fix for
        bug 327568 - treat check menu items similar to check boxes.

        * bugs/bug_322903.py, bugs/bug_322903.html, bugs/bugs.html,
        src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py: test case for showing how text can
        get jumbled as user types in a text area.  The ultimate cause
        of this is that getTextAtOffset seems to position the caret at
        the starting offset that is passed into the call to getTextAtOffset.

2006-01-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/gaim.py: alternative logic to address bug 325917.
        I think the ultimate culprit may be the toolkit, but I think this
        workaround should hopefully work in the presence and/or absence of
        the possible toolkit bug.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/input_event.py:
        keep track of mouse button events as another means for watching
        caret moved events.

        * src/tools/bug_template.py: adjust for bad indentation caused by
        emacs somehow messing up the indentation parameters.

        * src/orca/settings.py: add another alias for Firefox ("Deer
        Park") to manage unreleased versions of Firefox.

2006-01-13  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted the onFocus() method to handle the following for the
          mail message header list:

          If the current locus of focus is not a table cell, then we
          are entering the mail message header list (rather than moving
          around inside it), so speak the number of mail messages total.

2006-01-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/debug.py: Add Insert+Ctrl+F5 as
        a means to cycle the debug level.  I originally started making
        this a dialog box, but realized that interacting with it can
        cause a flurry of AT-SPI events.  So...I dumbed this down to
        a simple cycle (press Insert+Ctrl+F5 repeatedly to cycle through
        the possible debug level values).

2006-01-12  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Tightened up the code in case "3)" in the onFocus() method.
          It was possible that some of the table cells in the current
          row in the mail message header table were None. This is now
          specifically tested for, and if found, that table cell is skipped.

2006-01-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added in Evolution bug #326649.

2006-01-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added in code to the the onFocus() method to handle:
            Preferences Dialog: options list.

        If the focus is in one of the various options on the left side of
        the Preferences dialog. then we just want to speak the name of the
        page we are currently on.

        Even though it looks like the focus is on one of the page tabs
        in this dialog, it's possible that it's actually on a table cell,
        within a table which is contained within a scroll pane. We check
        for this my looking for a component hierarchy of "table cell",
        "table", "unknown" and "scroll pane".

        If this is the case, then we get the parent of the scroll pane
        and look to see if one of its other children is a "page tab list".
        If that's true, then we get the Nth child, when N is the index of
        the initial table cell minus 1. We double check that this is a
        "page tab", then if so, speak and braille that component.

        NOTE: assumes there is only one "page tab list" in the "filler"
        component.

        This change improves the situation dramatically, but sometime we
        are still getting this component spoken twice.

2006-01-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am: take care in installing on
        64-bit platforms

        * src/orca/gnomespeechfactory.py, src/orca/orca-setup.in:
        fix problem where speech will hang when using gnome speech
        and orca-setup.  The main cause was the introduction of
        callbacks, which will not work properly when bonobo main
        is not being used (which is the case with orca-setup).

2006-01-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: implement a mechanism to better handle
        the flat review of parents that manage a large number of descendants.
        This makes synaptic, for example, work a bit better with flat review.

2006-01-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html, bugs/bug_325809.py: add bug for table column
        headers not being taken into account for getAccessibleAtPoint

2005-12-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added in Evolution bug #324726.

2005-12-20  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added in code to the the onFocus() method to handle:
            Calendar view: day view: moving with arrow keys.

          If the focus is in the Calendar Day View, check to see if there
          are any appointments starting at the current time. If there are,
          then provide the user with useful feedback for that appointment,
          otherwise output the current time and state that there are no
          appointments.

2005-12-20  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added in a workaround for Evolution bug #324193.

2005-12-19  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Removed the "placeholder" code in the onFocus() method for the
          following three scenerios:
            * Calendar view: day view: tabbing to day with no appts.
            * Calendar view: day view: moving with arrow keys.
            * Calendar view: month calendar
          The default utterances would appear to be sufficient.

          Added in some calls to debug.println for the remaining four
          cases handled by the onFocus() method.

2005-12-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added in code to the onFocus() method to better handle calendar
          day view: tabbing to day with appts.

          If the focus is in the Calendar Day View on an appointment, then
          provide the user with userful feedback. First we get the current
          date and appointment summary from the parent. This is then followed
          by getting the information on the current appointment.

          The start time for the appointment is determined by detecting the
          equivalent child in the parent Calendar View's table has the same
          y position on the screen.

          The end time for the appointment is determined by using the height
          of the current appointment component divided by the height of a
          single child in the parent Calendar View's table

          Both of these time values depend upon the value of a time increment
          which is determined by the number of children in the parent Calendar
          View's table.

2005-12-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Fixed up the getTimeForCalRow() method to correctly handle all
          the possibly calendar day view appointment time increments that
          are possible.

2005-12-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added in a new  method:
          - getTimeForCalRow() which returns a string equivalent to the
            time of the given row in the calendar day view. Each calendar
            row is equivalent to 30 minutes, with time (row 0) starting
            at 12 am (midnight).

          More work on calendar appointment day view. If you now Tab into
          the day view and there are appointments for that day, then it's
          possible to determine the start time of each appointment using
          getTimeForCalRow().

2005-12-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added an entry for Evolution bug #324193. Bug #324104 is not
          a bug.

2005-12-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: partial workaround for link selection
        bug in Firefox.  Only works if the caret offset is accurate,
        which it isn't (see the related Firefox bug at
        https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=320395).

        * bugs/bugs.html, bugs/bug_{320383,320387,320388,320390,
        320393,320395}: Firefox bugs.

2005-12-14  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html
          Added entries for Evolution bugs #324002, #324005 and #324104.

2005-12-14  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added in the definitions for two new custom roles:
          - CALENDAR_VIEW
          - CALENDAR_EVENT
          These get added to the rolenames list in the rolenames module.

          Added in code to the onFocus() method to detect the following
          cases:
          - Calendar view: day view: tabbing to day with no appts.
          - Calendar view: day view: tabbing to day with appts.
          - Calendar view: day view: moving with arrow keys.
          - Calendar view: month calendar

          Code for these cases needs to be completed. At the moment it
          just prints out debug messages.

2005-12-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py: use object.role instead of rolenames.getRoleName
        for debug output.  It was too confusing the other way.

        * src/orca/default.py: start taking hypertext into account when
        speaking characters and words.

        * src/orca/settings.py: try to make hyperlink voice stand out for now

        * src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py: lots of evaluation of accessible
        hyperlink support.  Many test cases to write and bugs to file against
        Firefox :-(.

2005-12-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: with the exception of
        ImportErrors, print the stack trace for all errors encountered
        when importing a script at the SEVERE level.  This helps
        to better identify syntax errors and bugs in custom scripts.

        * src/orca/scripts/Mozilla.py, src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am:
        initial pass at getting us going with evaluating Firefox's
        AT-SPI implementation.  This does NOT provide any compelling
        access to Firefox at this point.

        * src/orca/default.py: permit presentation of caret moved
        events even on objects that are not the locus of focus.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/atspi.py: Rich's idea below
        looked so good that I added two new debug features: one to
        print an indented ancestry of an object and one to print
        the descendants of an object.  I bound these to a debug
        keystroke in Orca: Insert+F7 prints the ancestry for the
        locusOfFocus and Ctrl+Insert+F7 prints the application
        hierarchy for the locus of focus, flagging the locus of
        focus with the string "(*)".

2005-12-13  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added it two new methods:
          - walkComponentHierarchy() - a debug routine to print out
            the hierarchy of components for the given object.
          - isDesiredFocusedItem() - called to determine if the given
            object and it's hierarchy of parent objects, each have the
            desired roles.

          Adjusted the code in the onFocus() method to use the
          isDesiredFocusedItem() method.

2005-12-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bugs.html: create simple (let's try to keep it simple)
        table to help us keep track of bugs in our external dependencies

2005-12-09  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py

          Adjusted the handling of the message header list code in the
          onFocus() method to only braille the role of the table cell
          that currently has focus. This is achieved by adjusting the
          verbosity level of brailleRolenameStyle to VERBOSITY_LEVEL_BRIEF
          for the other table cells, restoring it to its original value
          at the end.

2005-12-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * bugs/bug_323633.py: standalone test case that demonstrates
        the issue where metacity sends accessible label information
        one window behind when using Alt+TAB to cycle between windows.
        Logged as bugzilla bug #323633.

2005-12-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py
          Added a new function displayRegions() that displays a list of
          regions on a single line, setting focus to the specified region.

        * src/orca/keynames.py
          Added a mapping of "SunF36" to "F 11"

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted the onFocus() method to use braille.displayRegions() to
          generate a braille display of multiple regions when displaying a
          message header or one of the four standard mail message pane
          header lines (assuming the user wants to speak the complete row).

2005-12-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>
        * src/orca/{default.py, settings.py}
          Slight tweak to the last change. The initial state for whether
          to read just the current table cell or the whole row, is
          determined by a variable in settings.py that the user can override.

2005-12-08  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          Added the ability to toggle whether we should speak/braille just
          the current table cell or the whole row. This is currently
          toggled with Insert+F11

2005-12-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Adjusted the code in the onFocus() method to update the braille
          display as well as providing speech output.

2005-12-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added code to the onFocus() method to handle the following case:
            When the focus is in the From:, To:, Subject: or Date: headers
            of a message in the message area, then we should read the whole
            row.
         See the comments in the Evolution.py script for further details.

2005-12-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added code to the onFocus() method to handle the following case:
            When the focus is in the pane containing the lines of an
            actual mail message, then, for each of those lines, we
            don't want to speak "text", the role of the component that
            currently has focus.
         See the comments in the Evolution.py script for further details.

2005-12-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py
          Adjusted the getSpeechContext() method to ignore speaking about
          objects the have an unknown role. This was an annoyance in the
          message pane window in Evolution.

2005-12-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/docs/doc-set/*: update architecture and script guides.

        * src/docs/pydoc/Makefile.am: update to include latest sources.

        * src/orca/orca.py: fix circular import for presentation managers
        to allow pydoc to work better.

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/atspi.py: pydoc improvements.

        * src/orca/kbd.y: remove obsolete file

        * src/orca/mag.py: I believe I finally have the import worked
        out on this correctly, and the primary cause (I think) was
        due to gnome-mag not building/installing the ORBit modules.
        I also submitted a bug/patch against gnome-mag:
        http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=323032.

2005-12-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Slight adjustment to look for the message header list by role
          rather than name, to avoid localisation problems.

2005-12-01  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Better handling of reading the details of the current message
          header that has focus. See comments in the Evolution.py script
          for further details.

2005-11-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/atspi.py: Fix for bug 319673: Accessible.__init__ now
        checks to make sure it is not passed a Python Accessible. If it is,
        it issues a warning and just returns the Python Accessible.

2005-11-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am: install orca convenience shell into
        ${bindir) instead of $(prefix)/bin

        * src/orca/speech.py: remove import of pdb

2005-11-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          Added in the debug message from Will for the onFocus method.

2005-11-29  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * Release 0.2.0

2005-11-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/tools/bug_template.py: add "direct to AT-SPI via IDL only"
        standalone module to help provide a template for filing bugs.  One
        may start with this file to create reproducable test cases for
        registering bugs against AT-SPI implementations.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: resolve problem with event
        sources being GC'd while waiting on the idle thread.

2005-11-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * Nearly everything: replace core module and a11y.py with atspi.py.

2005-11-17  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/a11y.py
          Better debugging support in _get_app().

2005-11-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/{default.py, input_event.py, keybindings.py, orca.py,
        script.py, speech.py}: refactor ability to handle custom keybinding
        maps from user-settings.py.

2005-11-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/{default.py, gnomespeechfactory.py, orca-setup.in,
        orca.py, settings.py, speech.py}, src/orca/scripts/Gecko.py:
        migrate voice defaults to setting.py.
        NOTE: THIS REQUIRES YOU TO RERUN ORCA-SETUP.

        * src/orca/*.py: use string constants to get settings (I got
        bit by a mispelling when using raw strings).

        * configure.in, Makefile.am, docs/pydoc/Makefile.am: only build
        pydoc if the "--enable-pydoc" option is used, and force this
        for distcheck.

        * po/POTFILES.in: make sure distcheck works

2005-11-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          src/orca/settings.py
          Adding in a "stub" Evolution script that currently does nothing
          except interpose on the onFocus() method and always pass the
          event onto the parent class. This script will be extended as needed.

2005-11-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/{a11y.py,braillegenerator.py,flat_review.py,
        focus_tracking_presenter.py,hierarchical_presenter.py,
        kbd.py,orca.py,speech.py,speechgenerator.py}: use "for i in range"
        idiom instead of the awkward "while" loops.

        * src/orca/{braille.py,debug.py,default.py,
        focus_tracking_presenter.py,hierarchical_presenter.py,kbd.py,
        mag.py,orca.py,settings.py}: remove unnecessary globals.

        * src/orca/*.py, src/orca/scripts/*.py: gross pychecker
        sweep to eliminate a number of potential bugs and ugliness.

        * src/orca/{Makefile.am,acss.py,dectalk.py,default.py,
        espeechfactory.py,gnomespeechfactory.py,orca-setup.in,
        orca.py,outloud.py,settings.py,speech.py,speechserver.py},
        src/orca/scripts/{Gecko.py,metacity.py}: new speech structure
        done in collaboration with T.V. Raman of Google who donated
        code under the LGPL license.  NOTE: THIS REQUIRES YOU TO
        RERUN ORCA-SETUP.

2005-11-14  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am src/orca/keynames.py
          src/orca/orca.py
          Before key event are spoken in the _keyEcho() routine, they are
          checked against a key event dictionary to see if there are
          localized  words to be spoken instead.

2005-11-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
        src/orca/scripts/*.py, docs/doc-set/script_guide.sgml: eliminate
        need for script factory paradigm.

2005-11-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/default.py,
        src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/orca-setup.in,
        src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py, src/orca/speech.py,
        src/orca/scripts/Gecko.py, src/orca/scripts/gaim.py,
        src/orca/scripts/gcalctool.py, src/orca/scripts/metacity.py: First
        pass at new speech system based on conversations with T.V. Raman.
        NOTE: THIS REQUIRES YOU TO RERUN ORCA-SETUP.  If you don't orca
        will fail on startup.

2005-11-09  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * Added test directories

2005-11-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * configure.in, docs/pydoc,
          docs/Makefile.am, docs/pydoc/Makefile.am
          Added in a new .../docs/pydoc directory where pydoc HTML
          documentation is generated for all the Orca Python files.

2005-11-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: really delete scripts when
        an application exits.  Fix for bug 319776.

2005-11-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/{a11y,default,focus_tracking_presenter,orca,script}.py:
        bubble COMM_FAILURES up to a higher level to allow for better
        tracking and debugging of these events.

2005-11-03  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          (Per suggestion from Will) Moved the braille.addLine() call
          in the updateBraille() method, to prevent a "list index out of
          range" exception.

2005-11-03  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Added a onCaretMoved() method which simply calls the
          same method in its parent class. Now movement from one line in
          a text document to the next, just results in the new line
          being spoken once (compared with both the last line and the
          new line being spoken upto two times each). Need to investigate
          further why this happens.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py
          Added a check in getBrailleRegions(). Sometimes, for some
          unknown reason, the child is None. We now test for this,
          rather than cause a traceback.

        * src/orca/a11y.py:
          Fix from Will. Adjustments to the makeAccessible() method to
          better handle invalid objects in the local cache. This routine
          no longer throws an InvalidObjectError exception.

2005-11-03  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/debug.py,
        src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: toString work on
        an accessible (note there is still plenty of opportunity
        for object-oriented programming in a11y.py).

2005-11-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py: added a call to:

          self.keybindings = keybindings.KeyBindings()

          in the __init__ method, to prevent Orca going into flat
          review mode when you typed in something like "t".

2005-11-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: added a debug message
          to one of the except: clauses in processObjectEvent().

        * src/orca/a11.y: adjusted some of the debug messages in the
          __get_app routine to check whether obj.name and
          obj.parent.name are None, in which case "None" is printed;
          otherwise "'<name>'".

2005-10-31  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * Initial version of StarOffice.py script. Support for
          "object:state-changed:armed" events.

2005-10-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/debug.py: add ability to send debug output to a
        file (via debug.setDebugFile).  This should allow us to pass
        in a non-buffered file from user-settings.py, hopefully
        allowing us to better track where orca is hanging.

        * src/orca/*.py, src/orca/scripts/*.py: make the voicename
        for speaking be an optional parameter with a default value
        of "default".

        * src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
        src/orca/settings.py: fix for bug 32063 - provide a more
        flexible, general-purpose, and user-settable script discovery
        mechanism.

2005-10-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * QUICKSTART: add libgail-gnome to Ubuntu section as well as
        more apt-get stuff needed to build libgail-gnome.

        * src/orca/orca.py: fail a bit more gracefully if braille,
        speech, or mag are not available at run time.

2005-10-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py
          Added in a "debug.printException(debug.LEVEL_FINEST)" in
          _createScript() in the exception cluse when trying to load
          custom scripts (very useful during debugging).

2005-10-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: adjusted three debug statements to
          pass two parameters, not three.

2005-10-28  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.in, src/orca/orca.py: move all logic out of
        orca.in and move it into a new orca.py:main to help with
        debugging.

        * src/orca/*.py: do not silently pass on any exceptions - at
        least print an exception at debug.LEVEL_FINEST.  Also attempt
        to provide some debug output inside while loops that could
        potentially never exit.

2005-10-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am: take care in packaging on 64-bit
        platforms

        * src/orca/kbd.py: fix problem with not registering enough
        handlers to cover all possible modifier mask combinations;
        refactor a little bit to help enable testing with XEVIE.

2005-10-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
        various calls to _getBrailleTextForAvailability and
        _getSpeechForAvailability for radio, check and ordinary menuitems.

2005-10-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * TODO: Moved all TODOs to bugzilla.gnome.org as bugs and RFEs
        for the Orca component.  Also went through all the source code
        and logged all TODOs in there as bugs and RFEs, placing references
        to the bugzilla bug numbers in the source code.

2005-10-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * QUICKSTART: create and update.

        * src/brl/brlmodule.c: throw exceptions instead of printing errors
        when attempting to initialize/connect to BrlTTY.

        * src/orca/braille.py: set default braille display size to 32
        (this is for testing purposes and the default matches the actual
        display size of our primary tester)

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in: only enable accessibility if it has not
        already been enabled, thus avoiding a confusing message

2005-10-20  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: add ability to provide
        a mapping between application name and script module name

        * src/orca/scripts/*: refactor scripts into their own package

2005-10-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/script.py, src/orca/input_event.py,
        docs/doc-set/script_guide.sgml: begin working on script
        writing guide.

2005-10-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speech.py: do not lose last text sent when performing
        a reset after detecting a speech driver failure.

2005-10-11  Pawan Chitrakar  <pchitrakar@gmail.com>

        * configure.in: Added ne in ALL_LINGUAS

2005-10-07  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: eliminate a major source of hangs
        for flat review: getTextAtOffset is typically implemented
        incorrectly across (and possibly within) toolkits.

        * src/orca/gaim.py: improved braille and speech experience (at
        least for AIM)

2005-10-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: handle text objects that have
        children by ignoring the children

        * src/orca/gaim.py: hacking to get chat working again
        (at least for AIM)

2005-10-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: add support for no focus.

2005-09-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/flat_review.py,
        src/orca/braillegenerator.py: more work on keeping the spatial
        layout of braille relatively consistent.

2005-09-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/flat_review.py:
        hopefully a little better at flat review navigation using the
        buttons on the braille display

        * src/orca/braille.py: provide additional methods to find our way
        around and also provide more control over panning around.

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: provide ability to explicitly set the
        character of interest as well as ability to pass a character offset
        to a zone and find the word associated with it.

2005-09-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py: used
        rolenames constants instead of hard coded strings.

        * src/orca/default.py: use "above" and "below" semantics instead
        of "previous line" and "next line" for BrlTTY LNUP and LNDN.

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: in flat review mode, automatically pan
        to begin/end of previous/next lines when panning in braille.

2005-09-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: don't speak flat review info if the user
        navigated via input from the braille display.

        * src/orca/braille.py: strip trailing "\n" from lines for flat
        review mode.

        * src/orca/flat_review.py: do not add zero-sized zones to flat
        review context.

2005-09-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/flat_review.py:
        more work on flat review - rudimentary braille input and output
        working.

2005-09-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/flat_review.py:
        fair amount of work to get rudimentary flat review mode working
        (with speech only at this point).

2005-08-29  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: Add cancel button to record keystrokes dialog.

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in: fix typo in orcadir name (it was gorcadir).

        * src/tools/sanity_checker.py: tool to do a rough sanity check on
        keystroke files recorded by Orca or record_keystrokes.py

2005-08-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/default.py: better scrolling
        of braille display when the caret moves (e.g., by pressing a
        touch cursor or doing some keyboard navigation action).

        * src/orca/default.py: implement simple line clustering
        algorithm inspired by a number of seminal OCR publications.

        * src/orca/braille.py: implement suggestion from Dave Mielke
        to handle spurious keyboard repeats from various display
        drivers (e.g., the Alva).

2005-08-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/default.py: begin
        implementing spatial analysis techniques.

        * src/orca/a11y.py: clear the cache properly when the parent
        changes.

2005-08-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * Many files: add keybindings support to workaround the fact that
        AT-SPI doesn't give us keysyms.  As a result, keypad keys look
        like other keys on the keyboard (e.g., the left arrow on the
        keypad looks similar to the left arrow on the keyboard).  The only
        way to distinguish these things right now is by keycode.
        But...different systems emit different keycodes, so we need to
        resolve keycodes at runtime.  Also took this opportunity to fix
        the problem where key releases of Orca keys were always being
        passed on to applications rather than being consumed.  Note that
        all these changes introduce a new dependency on glib and also
        require the DISPLAY environment variable to be set.

2005-08-23  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: add
        ability to record keystrokes to a file - press the "Pause" key
        to start/stop recording.

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/speech.py: change LEVEL_INFO
        output to be more test friendly.

2005-08-16  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

        * src/orca/rolenames.py: reduced verbosity for page tabs and page
        tab lists

2005-08-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py: reduce verbosity for page tabs.

        * src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
        src/orca/braillegenerator.py: include accessible image description
        for icons if it exists.

        * src/orca/eventsynthesizer.py, src/orca/Makefile.am: create to
        allow mouse and keyboard events to be synthesized by Orca

        * src/orca/braille.py: use eventsynthesizer to generate mb1 clicks
        for those objects that don't have actions (e.g., page tabs).

        * src/orca/a11y.py: do not cache extents because they can get out
        of date if the object is moved and we currently do not have a way
        to determine if this has happened.

2005-08-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py: show
        text lines with their labels.

        * src/orca/rolenames.py: minor consistency tweaking on rolenames.

2005-08-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: hack to better support the very poor
        application behavior exhibited by Evolution's account setup
        wizard: it will end up in situations where the active dialog
        doesn't have any components with focus.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/a11y.py,
        src/orca/speechgenerator.py: first pass at automatically speaking
        panels when they are realized on the screen.

2005-08-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
        remove extraneous "region" field from constructor.

        * src/orca/default.py: add factory methods to get braille and
        speech generator objects so as to allow subclasses to more
        easily override the generators.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: ignore the
        "object:state-changed:iconified" event for now to help avoid
        tickling a nasty bug with gedit.  Tickling gedit when it is
        starting can cause gedit to issue the following message:
        (gedit:31434): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: invalid cast from
        `SpiAccessible' to `BonoboControlAccessible'.  It seems as though
        whenever this message is issued, gedit will hang when you try to
        exit it.

        * src/orca/gedit.py, src/orca/Makefile.am: new script to override
        the _getSpeechForFrame method so as to avoid tickling the same bug
        described above.

        * src/orca/a11y.py: add ability to turn local caching of object
        values on or off via the a11y.CACHE_VALUES field.  The default
        value is True, which means to do caching.

        * src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/orca.py: start keeping better
        tracking of CORBA COMM FAILURES; throw a11y.InvalidObjectError
        exceptions and set the "valid" field of the Accessible to False
        when these errors are detected.

2005-08-08  Maxim Dziumanenko <mvd@mylinux.ua>

        * configure.in: Added "uk" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-08-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py: work on verbosity

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/speech.py,
        src/orca/default.py: work on verbosity.  Move speechgenerator to
        a list of utterances rather than a single string containing
        multiple sentences; this avoids spurious punctuation being sent
        to the synthesis engine.

2005-08-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/a11y.py: uncache label on name or description change

        * src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
        src/orca/braillegenerator.py: add ability to speak tree node level

        * src/orca/braille.py: add return to home functionality for when
        the user presses CMD_HOME.

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
        src/orca/braillegenerator.py: do some work on speech and braille
        for tables.

2005-08-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py: try not to speak fillers.

        * src/orca/default.py: handle issue where parents that manage
        descendants will potentially give a unique accessible instance
        for the same child each time getChildAtIndex is called.

        * src/orca/default.py: use selection changed events on specific
        roles to update the locus of focus.

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py: remove the speaking of unavailable
        if the object is an icon.

        * src/orca/speechgenerator.py._getSpeechForAlert: when presenting
        a dialog, do not grab "free" labels that are children of a push
        button.

        * src/orca/a11y.py.__get_label: obtain the names of push buttons
        a little better; push buttons can have labels as children and
        can also be labelled by something.

        * src/orca/default.py.onNameChanged: ignore name changes
        on dialogs that have focus for now; the motivator for this is that
        gnome-terminal appears to issue name change events on the
        "Edit" -> "Current Profile..."  dialog even though the name didn't
        change.

2005-07-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speech.py: add recovery from failure to register speech
        callback with FreeTTS driver on Fedora (it works fine on
        JDS/Suse).  Not quite sure what is going on here, but something
        deep in the bowels of CORBA is croaking.

2005-07-29  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: better handling of menu and focus events
        for setting the locusOfFocus.

        * src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/orca.py: add speech rate
        increase/decrease functionality (still needs work to make
        sure it doesn't go out of parameter bounds).

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py: style guide work for menus.

2005-07-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * a11y.py, braille.py, debug.py, default.py,
        focus_tracking_presenter.py, hierarchical_presenter.py, metacity.py,
        orca.py, script.py, speechgenerator.py: begin developing the
        notion of locus of focus and visual appearance change.

2005-07-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: add ability to treat the insert key as a
        modifier.  Use insert+F1 to enter learn mode.

        * src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/default.py,
        src/orca/speechgenerator.py: fix some speech generator issues with
        toggle buttons as well as verbosity (accidentally told the
        generators to speak too little).

2005-07-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py,
        src/orca/rolenames.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py,
        src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/settings.py: add speech and
        braille generator concepts; also do a very rough (and poor) pass
        at trying to implement the output style guidelines.

        * src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/orca.in: move signal handling to
        orca.in.

2005-06-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/default.py,
        src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
        src/orca/hierarchical_presenter.py, src/orca/input_event.py,
        src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/script.py, src/orca/settings.py: add
        learn mode.

2005-06-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: Register a signal handler for ctrl-C.

2005-06-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py,
        src/orca/script.py: rough pass at allowing user defined
        keybindings to override key bindings in scripts.

        * TODO: update to include issues with autogen.

2005-06-23  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/*: bite the bullet and make scripts full-fledged
        classes.  This allow scripts to better maintain state across
        activations of the same window, and to allow for more unique
        scripts when running the same application more than once.

2005-06-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/*: put Orca in its own "orca" package to avoid
        cluttering the default python namespace.

2005-06-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/*.py: incorporate prototype Braille support.

2005-06-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/brl/brlmodule.c,src/orca/*.py: prepare to move Braille
        region logic into Python.  The brlmodule.c will then serve
        as an interface to BrlTTY.

2005-06-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/debug.py,src/orca/default.py,src/orca/orca/py: begin
        bringing Braille input back to life.

        * src/orca/*.py: try to follow the public/private naming
        convention (i.e., use "_" prefix for private fields) more.

        * src/orca/script.py: renamed "mod"-related fields to "custom"
        because I kept getting confused.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,src/orca/orca.py,
        src/orca/script.py,src/orca/gaim.py: only reload a script
        when a window is activated (the current implementation was
        reloading a script for every event received).

2005-06-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/a11y.py: don't set object's parent attribute if it has
        not been defined yet; instead just return None from __getattr__.

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: get rid of
        "ERROR: app not found" message.

        * src/orca/debug.py: reformatting of event output.

        * src/orca/orca.py,hierarchical_presenter.py: add simple code to
        draw outlines around an accessible.  This has the impact of now
        requiring the DISPLAY to be set before running Orca.

2005-06-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py: make processKeyEvent a little (maybe not a
        lot) smarter about handling control characters.

2005-06-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py,debug.py: add the ability to filter event
        output based on a regular expression.  This is for debug purposes
        only.  The next step is to enable a keystroke in Orca to allow
        the filter to be set/reset to allow for specific event tracking.

        * src/orca/*.py: add notion of a "presentation manager" to allow
        for presentation managers such as "focus tracking", "flat review"
        and "hierarchical".  Split the current presentation code out from
        orca.py into focus_tracking_presenter.py.  Also created new (and
        very experimental) hierarchical_presenter.py to allow for some
        detailed exploration of the at-spi component hierarchy.

2005-04-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/*.py: anal-retentive refactoring and surface level
        formatting of code.

2005-04-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: attempt at comboBoxPresenter.

2005-04-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py: fix bug in the way state_change_notifiers
        were handled (list with one item was being exploded into
        individual characters, which is not what we want), improve page
        tab presenter, update text presenter.

        * src/orca/gnome-terminal.py: remove the text event handlers
        because they were identical to default.py.

2005-04-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/debug.py: allow debugLevel to be set/used on the fly
        rather than the somewhat static way it was being done.  The
        way to use it now is to "import debug" in settings.py (or anywhere
        else) and then do "debug.setDebugLevel(debug.LEVEL_CONFIGURATION)"
        somewhere else.

        * src/orca/speech.py: more gracefully recover from failures
        if/when the speech service dies.  Right now, on any failure, the
        speech module will reset and reconnect to the speech server
        rather than just groaning about a COMM_FAILURE.

2005-04-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/a11y.py: add an attempt at getting the group

        * src/orca/rolenames.py: sync up with ATK rolenames

        * src/orca/speech.py: capture CORBA failures for now

        * src/orca/default.py: passes at defaultPresenter,
        pushButtonPresenter, toggleButtonPresenter, radioButtonPresenter,
        menuBarPresenter, menuPresenter, and sliderPresenter.

        * docs/programmers-guide/programmers-guide.{sgml,pdf}: some
        level of introduction to style.  Still much work to do when it
        comes to notions of levels of verbosity and speaker style.

2005-04-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/{a11y.py, debug.py, default.py, kbd.py, metacity,py,
        orca.py, rolenames.py, speech.py}: finer grained control over
        debugging.  Debugging is now set by a numerical value rather than
        a boolean.  See debug.py for the different levels.  To turn
        debugging on, set "debugLevel = 500" (or some appropriate number)
        in settings.py.  For backwards compatibility, "debug = True" in
        this file will default to debug.LEVEL_FINER.

2005-04-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am: add debug.py to orca_python_PYTHON

2005-04-01  Steve Murphy  <murf@e-tools.com>

        * configure.in: Added "rw" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-04-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * default-keybindings.ppy, default.py, speech.py: add sayAgain
        support to repeat last utterance spoken

        * default.py: more work to be in line with gnopernicus

        * rolenames.py: import text for speech and Braille from gnopernicus

        * speech.py: interrupt speech when given something new to say

        * mag.py: a little better (but far from perfect) way to move ROI
        to match object with focus; also add support for tracking mouse events

2005-03-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * gnome-terminal.py:  call default.brlUpdateText

        * a11y.py: add capability to get component extents from
        an accessible

        * orca.py, default.py: add beginnings of magnification support

        * mag.py: early magnification support

2005-03-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * Upgrade to brltty-3.6.1 (TODO: perhaps add backwards
        compatibility in if people complain.).

        * Add *.pyc (compiled *.py files) to src/orca/.cvsignore.

        * Use try/except blocks more sparingly to allow for easier
        debugging.  Also add more debugging features to debug.py.
        A quite note on debugging: add "debug = True" to
        ~/.orca/settings.py to turn debugging on.

        * Fix presentation of radio and checkbox menu items.

        * Make menus speak like Gnopernicus for now.

        * Backout a11y.py workaround for Nautilus shortcomings; it turns
        out this workaround was hurting the overall logic.

2005-02-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * Remove src/orca/dispatcher.py as it was obsoleted by the
        dispatcher table in a11y.py.

2005-02-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * Nearly every source file: added much documentation and many
        TODO comments.

2005-02-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py (init): remove call to core.init() as this
        is done in a11y.init().  The dual call was causing orca to crash.

2005-02-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * src/orca/speech.py (init): add extra parameters to call to
        bonobo.activation.activate_from_id as a result of change to
        gnome-python on 2004-12-13.

2005-02-03  Alessio Frusciante  <algol@firenze.linux.it>

        * configure.in: Added "it" (Italian) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-01-17      Amanpreet Singh Alam <amanpreetalam@yahoo.com>

        * configure.in: "pa" is Added to ALL_LINGUAS

2004-10-16  Danilo Šegan  <dsegan@gmx.net>

        * configure.in: Added "sr" and "sr@Latn" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-09-09  Ankit Patel <ankit@redhat.com>

        * configure.in: Added 'gu' (Gujarati) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-08-27  Marc Mulcahy  <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

        * src/orca/orca.py (init): Display an error message and exit if
        the registry can't be activated (i.E. the Orca core can't be
        initialized)

        * src/core/coremodule.c (core_module_init): Fix return values on
        exception.

2004-08-21  Francisco Javier F. Serrador  <serrador@cvs.gnome.org>

        * configure.in: Added "es" (Spanish) translation.

2004-07-14  Marc Mulcahy  <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

        * src/orca/a11y.py (Accessible.__del__): The unref might throw a
        CORBA_COMM_FAILURE if the object has died.

2004-07-02  Hendrik Brandt  <hebra@cvs.gnome.org>

        * configure.in: Added "de" (German) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-06-30    <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

        * src/orca/a11y.py (Accessible.__get_relations): New
        implementation which makes sure relations are narrowed to make
        sure things work right with Java.
        (Accessible.__get_app): Get app also fails if the thing it finds
        is not an application.
        (onWindowActivated): Make sure focussedAp is narrowed so it works
        right with Java.
        (onFocus): Since we're tracking the active application, objects
        which get focus get their app attribute set to the active
        application-- this hack is needed for Nautilus.
        (getLabel): Ensure the target that we get from a relation is an
        accessible wrapper.

        * src/orca/Gecko.py (presentNextHypertext): Fixed to use new
        accessible wrapper.
        (onFocus): Fixed to use new accessible wrapper.

        * src/orca/orca.in: Don't speak "Welcome to Orca" here-- now
        spoken in orca.py in start.

2004-06-28  Christophe Merlet  <redfox@redfoxcenter.org>

        * configure.in: Added "fr" (French) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-06-25    <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

        * NEWS: UPdated.

        * configure.in: UPdated version to 0.1.0.

        * src/orca/gaim.py: Updated to new accessible wrappers and script
        model.

        * src/orca/Makefile.am (orca_python_PYTHON): Added gnome-terminal
        and metacity scripts.

        * src/orca/script.py: Changed the way scripts work.  All scripts
        are loaded at once -- script activation was changed to include
        activating keybinding sets and brlKey handlers.

        * src/orca/rolenames.py (getRoleName): Use new accessible wrapper.

        * src/orca/orca.py (init): Register event listeners for tracking
        window activation/deactivation for activating/deactivating
        scripts.
        (processEvent): Changed event processing to filter all at-spi
        events through one function which decides which script should
        receive each event.

        * src/orca/default.py: UPdated to use new accessible wrappers.

        * src/orca/a11y.py: Added an accessible wrapper in python. MOved
        all the listeners which update the object caches to a11y.py.

        * src/core/eventlistener.c: Don't include pyaccessible.h.

        * src/core/pyevent.c: The pyevent no longer includes a
        pyaccessible as the source -- it includes a pycorba_object.
        (pyevent_dealloc): Free the any_data.
        (pyevent_get_source): The source is now a pycora_object rather
        than a pyaccessible.

        * src/core/coremodule.c: Removed pyaccessible stuff including all
        the event handlers which refresh the cache.

        * Removed src/core/pyaccessible.c and src/core/pyaccessible.h --
        the accessible wrappers are now written in Python in
        src/orca/a11y.py.

2004-06-10  Marc Mulcahy  <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am (orca_python_PYTHON): Add a default
        settings file.

        * src/orca/speech.py (init): If the settings file does not specify
        any voices, as is the case for the default settings file, then
        select the first voice of the first driver as the default.

        * src/brl/brlmodule.c (brl_module_init): Return false rather than
        returning NULL when the brlapi library can't be found, or any
        functions within brlapi can't be found.

        * configure.in: Don't use PYTHON_PKGDIR.
        Change version number to 0.0.13.
        Generate spec file.

        * Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added spec file to the distribution.

        * NEWS: Updated.

        * orca.spec.in: Checked spec file into cvs.

        * src/orca/orca.in: Remove path fiddling which is broken when
        packaging Orca anyway.

        * src/orca/orca-setup.in: Remove path fiddling which is broken
        when packaging Orca anyway.

        * src/orca/Makefile.am (orca_path_DATA): Added orca.pth to solve
        packaging issues.

        * src/orca/Makefile.am (orca_python_PYTHON): Install orca_i18n.py
        in the right place.

2004-06-10  Gustavo Noronha Silva  <kov@debian.org>

        * configure.in: added pt_BR to ALL_LINGUAS
