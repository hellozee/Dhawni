In order to generate the HTML and PDF versions of the orca
documentation perform the following steps from the docs/doc-set
directory after installing the docbook-utils.

To generate the pdf documentation:
    db2pdf internals.sgml

To generate the HTML docs:
    db2html --nochunks internals.sgml

The HTML will be generated in a subdirectory.  You need to copy
it to the current directory or the image links will not work.

On OpenSolaris:

xsltproc --nonet -xinclude -o internals.html /usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.69.1-5.1/html/docbook.xsl internals.sgml
